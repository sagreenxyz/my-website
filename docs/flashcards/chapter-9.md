# Chapter 9 Flashcards: Joints

## Structural Classification of Joints

**Q: What are the three structural classifications of joints based on how bones are held together?**
**A:**
1.  **Fibrous Joints:** Bones united by fibrous connective tissue.
2.  **Cartilaginous Joints:** Bones united by cartilage (hyaline or fibrocartilage).
3.  **Synovial Joints:** Bones articulate within a fluid-filled joint cavity.

## Functional Classification of Joints

**Q: What are the three functional classifications of joints based on the degree of movement?**
**A:**
1.  **Synarthrosis:** Immobile joint (provides strong connection).
2.  **Amphiarthrosis:** Slightly movable joint.
3.  **Diarthrosis:** Freely movable joint (all synovial joints are diarthroses).

## Fibrous Joints

**Q: What are the three types of fibrous joints?**
**A:**
1.  **Suture:** Narrow fibrous joint uniting skull bones (synarthrosis).
2.  **Gomphosis:** Anchors tooth root to jaw socket via periodontal ligaments (synarthrosis).
3.  **Syndesmosis:** Bones connected by ligaments or an interosseous membrane (e.g., between radius/ulna, tibia/fibula) (amphiarthrosis).

## Cartilaginous Joints

**Q: What are the two types of cartilaginous joints?**
**A:**
1.  **Synchondrosis:** Bones united by hyaline cartilage (e.g., epiphyseal plate [temporary], first sternocostal joint [permanent]) (synarthrosis).
2.  **Symphysis:** Bones united by fibrocartilage (e.g., pubic symphysis, intervertebral discs) (amphiarthrosis).

## Synovial Joints

**Q: What characterizes a synovial joint?**
**A:** Presence of a joint cavity containing synovial fluid, articular cartilage covering bone ends, and an articular capsule enclosing the joint.

**Q: What structures strengthen synovial joints?**
**A:** Ligaments (extrinsic, intrinsic, intracapsular), muscles/tendons crossing the joint, and sometimes articular discs (menisci).

**Q: What are bursae and tendon sheaths?**
**A:**
*   **Bursae:** Fluid-filled sacs reducing friction between skin/bone, muscle/bone, or tendon/bone.
*   **Tendon Sheaths:** Elongated bursae surrounding tendons, reducing friction during movement.

**Q: What are the six types of synovial joints based on shape?**
**A:**
1.  **Pivot:** Allows rotation around a single axis (uniaxial).
2.  **Hinge:** Allows flexion/extension (uniaxial).
3.  **Condyloid:** Allows flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, circumduction (biaxial).
4.  **Saddle:** Allows flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, circumduction (biaxial).
5.  **Plane (Gliding):** Allows small gliding or rotational movements (multiaxial).
6.  **Ball-and-Socket:** Allows flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, circumduction, rotation (multiaxial - greatest range of motion).

## Types of Body Movements

**Q: Define Flexion and Extension.**
**A:**
*   **Flexion:** Decreases the angle between bones (bending).
*   **Extension:** Increases the angle between bones (straightening). Hyperextension is extension beyond the normal anatomical position.

**Q: Define Abduction and Adduction.**
**A:**
*   **Abduction:** Moves a limb laterally away from the body midline.
*   **Adduction:** Moves a limb medially toward the body midline.

**Q: Define Circumduction.**
**A:** Movement of a limb in a circular manner (combines flexion, extension, abduction, adduction).

**Q: Define Rotation.**
**A:** Movement of a bone around its own long axis (medial/internal or lateral/external).

**Q: Define Supination and Pronation.**
**A:** (Forearm movements)
*   **Supination:** Rotation turning palm anteriorly or upward.
*   **Pronation:** Rotation turning palm posteriorly or downward.

**Q: Define Dorsiflexion and Plantar Flexion.**
**A:** (Ankle movements)
*   **Dorsiflexion:** Lifting the front of the foot (toes toward shin).
*   **Plantar Flexion:** Pointing the toes downward (like standing on tiptoe).

**Q: Define Inversion and Eversion.**
**A:** (Foot movements)
*   **Inversion:** Turning the sole of the foot medially.
*   **Eversion:** Turning the sole of the foot laterally.

**Q: Define Protraction and Retraction.**
**A:**
*   **Protraction:** Anterior movement (e.g., pushing jaw or shoulder forward).
*   **Retraction:** Posterior movement (e.g., pulling jaw or shoulder back).

**Q: Define Elevation and Depression.**
**A:**
*   **Elevation:** Superior movement (e.g., shrugging shoulders upward).
*   **Depression:** Inferior movement (e.g., lowering shoulders).

**Q: Define Opposition and Reposition.**
**A:** (Thumb movement)
*   **Opposition:** Touching the tip of the thumb to the tip of another finger on the same hand.
*   **Reposition:** Returning the thumb to its anatomical position.

## Selected Synovial Joints

**Q: What type of joint is the Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ)? What movements does it allow?**
**A:** Modified hinge joint; allows depression/elevation, protraction/retraction, and side-to-side movements of the mandible. Contains an articular disc.

**Q: What type of joint is the Glenohumeral (Shoulder) Joint? What provides its primary support?**
**A:** Multiaxial ball-and-socket joint; provides wide range of motion. Primary support comes from rotator cuff muscles. Glenoid labrum deepens the socket slightly.

**Q: What type of joint is the Elbow Joint?**
**A:** Uniaxial hinge joint, primarily involving humerus, ulna, and radius; allows flexion/extension.

**Q: What type of joint is the Hip Joint? How does it compare to the shoulder?**
**A:** Multiaxial ball-and-socket joint; strong ligaments restrict movement compared to the shoulder, providing stability for weight-bearing. Acetabular labrum deepens the socket.

**Q: What articulations make up the Knee Joint? What type of joint is it primarily?**
**A:** Includes femoropatellar joint and medial/lateral tibiofemoral joints. Primarily a modified hinge joint allowing flexion/extension and some rotation when flexed.

**Q: What key ligaments support the Knee Joint?**
**A:**
*   **Extrinsic:** Tibial (Medial) Collateral Ligament (MCL), Fibular (Lateral) Collateral Ligament (LCL).
*   **Intrinsic (Cruciate):** Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL - resists hyperextension), Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL - prevents anterior sliding of femur).
*   **Menisci (Medial & Lateral):** Articular discs improving fit and providing padding.

**Q: What type of joint is the Talocrural (Ankle) Joint? What movements does it allow?**
**A:** Uniaxial hinge joint between talus, tibia, and fibula; allows dorsiflexion and plantar flexion.

**Q: What ligaments support the Ankle Joint?**
**A:**
*   **Medial:** Deltoid ligament (resists eversion).
*   **Lateral:** Anterior/Posterior Talofibular ligaments, Calcaneofibular ligament (resist inversion - commonly injured in sprains).

## Joint Development

**Q: From what embryonic tissue do bones and joints develop?**
**A:** Mesenchyme.

**Q: How do synovial joints form in the limbs?**
**A:** Mesenchyme forms cartilage models of bones; a joint interzone develops between them; cell death centrally forms the joint cavity; surrounding mesenchyme forms the articular capsule.

**Q: What is endochondral ossification?**
**A:** The process by which a hyaline cartilage model is converted into bone (most limb bones form this way). Articular cartilage remains at joint surfaces.

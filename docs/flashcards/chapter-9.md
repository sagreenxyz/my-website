# Chapter 9 Flashcards: Joints

## Structural Classification of Joints

**Q: What are the three structural classifications of joints based on how bones are held together?**
**A:**
1.  **Fibrous Joints:** Bones united by fibrous connective tissue.
2.  **Cartilaginous Joints:** Bones united by cartilage (hyaline or fibrocartilage). *(Etymology: cartilago = gristle)*
3.  **Synovial Joints:** Bones articulate within a fluid-filled joint cavity. *(Etymology: syn = together, ovia = egg [referring to the fluid])*

## Functional Classification of Joints

**Q: What are the three functional classifications of joints based on the degree of movement?**
**A:**
1.  **Synarthrosis:** Immobile joint (provides strong connection). *(Etymology: syn = together, arthron = joint, osis = condition)*
2.  **Amphiarthrosis:** Slightly movable joint. *(Etymology: amphi = on both sides, arthron = joint, osis = condition)*
3.  **Diarthrosis:** Freely movable joint (all synovial joints are diarthroses). *(Etymology: di = through/apart, arthron = joint, osis = condition)*

## Fibrous Joints

**Q: What are the three types of fibrous joints?**
**A:**
1.  **Suture:** Narrow fibrous joint uniting skull bones (synarthrosis). *(Etymology: sutura = seam)*
2.  **Gomphosis:** Anchors tooth root to jaw socket via periodontal ligaments (synarthrosis). *(Etymology: gomphos = bolt/nail, osis = condition)*
3.  **Syndesmosis:** Bones connected by ligaments or an interosseous membrane (e.g., between radius/ulna, tibia/fibula) (amphiarthrosis). *(Etymology: syn = together, desmos = band/ligament, osis = condition)*

## Cartilaginous Joints

**Q: What are the two types of cartilaginous joints?**
**A:**
1.  **Synchondrosis:** Bones united by hyaline cartilage (e.g., epiphyseal plate [temporary], first sternocostal joint [permanent]) (synarthrosis). *(Etymology: syn = together, chondros = cartilage, osis = condition)*
2.  **Symphysis:** Bones united by fibrocartilage (e.g., pubic symphysis, intervertebral discs) (amphiarthrosis). *(Etymology: syn = together, physis = growth)*

---

## Synovial Joints

**Q: What characterizes a synovial joint?**
**A:** Presence of a joint cavity containing synovial fluid, articular cartilage covering bone ends, and an articular capsule enclosing the joint. *(Etymology: articulus = joint)*

**Q: What structures strengthen synovial joints?**
**A:** Ligaments (extrinsic, intrinsic, intracapsular), muscles/tendons crossing the joint, and sometimes articular discs (menisci). *(Etymology: ligamentum = band; meniskos = crescent)*

**Q: What are bursae and tendon sheaths?**
**A:**
*   **Bursae:** Fluid-filled sacs reducing friction between skin/bone, muscle/bone, or tendon/bone. *(Etymology: bursa = purse)*
*   **Tendon Sheaths:** Elongated bursae surrounding tendons, reducing friction during movement. *(Etymology: tendo = to stretch)*

**Q: What are the six types of synovial joints based on shape?**
**A:**
1.  **Pivot:** Allows rotation around a single axis (uniaxial).
2.  **Hinge:** Allows flexion/extension (uniaxial).
3.  **Condyloid:** Allows flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, circumduction (biaxial). *(Etymology: kondylos = knuckle)*
4.  **Saddle:** Allows flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, circumduction (biaxial).
5.  **Plane (Gliding):** Allows small gliding or rotational movements (multiaxial).
6.  **Ball-and-Socket:** Allows flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, circumduction, rotation (multiaxial - greatest range of motion).

## Types of Body Movements

**Q: Define Flexion and Extension.**
**A:**
*   **Flexion:** Decreases the angle between bones (bending). *(Etymology: flexio = bending)*
*   **Extension:** Increases the angle between bones (straightening). Hyperextension is extension beyond the normal anatomical position. *(Etymology: ex = out, tendere = to stretch)*

**Q: Define Abduction and Adduction.**
**A:**
*   **Abduction:** Moves a limb laterally away from the body midline. *(Etymology: ab = away, ducere = to lead)*
*   **Adduction:** Moves a limb medially toward the body midline. *(Etymology: ad = toward, ducere = to lead)*

**Q: Define Circumduction.**
**A:** Movement of a limb in a circular manner (combines flexion, extension, abduction, adduction). *(Etymology: circum = around, ducere = to lead)*

**Q: Define Rotation.**
**A:** Movement of a bone around its own long axis (medial/internal or lateral/external). *(Etymology: rotare = to turn)*

**Q: Define Supination and Pronation.**
**A:** (Forearm movements)
*   **Supination:** Rotation turning palm anteriorly or upward. *(Etymology: supinus = lying on the back)*
*   **Pronation:** Rotation turning palm posteriorly or downward. *(Etymology: pronus = leaning forward)*

**Q: Define Dorsiflexion and Plantar Flexion.**
**A:** (Ankle movements)
*   **Dorsiflexion:** Lifting the front of the foot (toes toward shin). *(Etymology: dorsum = back)*
*   **Plantar Flexion:** Pointing the toes downward (like standing on tiptoe). *(Etymology: planta = sole of the foot)*

**Q: Define Inversion and Eversion.**
**A:** (Foot movements)
*   **Inversion:** Turning the sole of the foot medially. *(Etymology: in = into, vertere = to turn)*
*   **Eversion:** Turning the sole of the foot laterally. *(Etymology: e = out, vertere = to turn)*

**Q: Define Protraction and Retraction.**
**A:**
*   **Protraction:** Anterior movement (e.g., pushing jaw or shoulder forward). *(Etymology: pro = forward, trahere = to draw)*
*   **Retraction:** Posterior movement (e.g., pulling jaw or shoulder back). *(Etymology: re = back, trahere = to draw)*

**Q: Define Elevation and Depression.**
**A:**
*   **Elevation:** Superior movement (e.g., shrugging shoulders upward). *(Etymology: elevare = to lift up)*
*   **Depression:** Inferior movement (e.g., lowering shoulders). *(Etymology: de = down, premere = to press)*

**Q: Define Opposition and Reposition.**
**A:** (Thumb movement)
*   **Opposition:** Touching the tip of the thumb to the tip of another finger on the same hand. *(Etymology: ob = against, ponere = to place)*
*   **Reposition:** Returning the thumb to its anatomical position. *(Etymology: re = again, ponere = to place)*

## Joint Development

**Q: From what embryonic tissue do bones and joints develop?**
**A:** Mesenchyme. *(Etymology: mesos = middle, enchyma = infusion)*

**Q: How do synovial joints form in the limbs?**
**A:** Mesenchyme forms cartilage models of bones; a joint interzone develops between them; cell death centrally forms the joint cavity; surrounding mesenchyme forms the articular capsule.

**Q: What is endochondral ossification?**
**A:** The process by which a hyaline cartilage model is converted into bone (most limb bones form this way). Articular cartilage remains at joint surfaces. *(Etymology: endon = within, chondros = cartilage; os = bone, facere = to make)*

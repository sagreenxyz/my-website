## Key Nursing Diagnoses

### Parkinson's Disease Nursing Care Plan

<details>
  <summary>
    Impaired Physical Mobility / Risk for Falls
  </summary>

  <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> Impaired Physical Mobility related to muscle rigidity, bradykinesia/akinesia, tremor, and postural instability as evidenced by shuffling gait, difficulty initiating movement ("freezing"), slowed movements, decreased dexterity, impaired balance, reliance on assistive devices, history of falls.</p>

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="outcomes" label="Desired Outcomes" default>
      <ul>
        <li>Patient will maintain optimal mobility within the limits of the disease progression.</li>
        <li>Patient will demonstrate safe transfer and ambulation techniques.</li>
        <li>Patient will utilize assistive devices correctly and consistently as needed.</li>
        <li>Patient will remain free from falls and related injuries.</li>
        <li>Patient will participate in recommended exercise programs (e.g., PT/OT recommendations).</li>
      </ul>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="interventions" label="Nursing Interventions">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Assess:</strong> Regularly assess gait, balance, posture, range of motion (ROM), muscle rigidity, tremor severity, and functional mobility (e.g., ability to rise from chair, turn in bed, walk). Assess fall risk using a standardized scale. Monitor for orthostatic hypotension. Assess home environment for safety hazards.</li>
        <li><strong>Promote Exercise/Movement:</strong> Encourage active and passive ROM exercises daily to maintain joint flexibility and reduce rigidity. Encourage regular ambulation, supervising or assisting as needed. Collaborate with Physical Therapy (PT) for specific exercise programs (stretching, strengthening, balance training, gait training - e.g., LSVT BIG program).</li>
        <li><strong>Safety Measures:</strong> Teach techniques to overcome freezing episodes (e.g., stepping over an imaginary line, marching in place, using a rhythmic cue like counting or music). Ensure clear pathways, remove throw rugs, ensure adequate lighting. Recommend appropriate, non-slip footwear. Instruct on safe transfer techniques (e.g., using chair arms, pivoting). Ensure call light is within reach. Consider bed/chair alarms if high risk for falls.</li>
        <li><strong>Assistive Devices:</strong> Ensure proper use and fit of assistive devices (canes, walkers) as recommended by PT/OT.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication Timing:</strong> Administer anti-Parkinson medications <strong>on time</strong> as prescribed to optimize mobility during peak effect periods. Schedule demanding activities during these "on" times.</li>
      </ul>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="rationale" label="Rationale">
      <p>Regular assessment identifies changes and guides interventions. Exercise helps maintain function, flexibility, and balance. Safety measures reduce fall risk.

  <summary>
    Risk for Aspiration / Imbalanced Nutrition: Less Than Body Requirements
  </summary>

  <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> Risk for Aspiration related to neuromuscular impairment affecting swallowing (dysphagia) as evidenced by coughing/choking during meals, drooling, pocketing food, gurgly voice quality after swallowing, recurrent respiratory infections. (This risk directly impacts nutrition, potentially leading to Imbalanced Nutrition: Less Than Body Requirements).</p>

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="outcomes" label="Desired Outcomes" default>
      <ul>
        <li>Patient will maintain a clear airway and remain free from signs/symptoms of aspiration (e.g., coughing during/after meals, fever, abnormal lung sounds).</li>
        <li>Patient will demonstrate safe swallowing techniques.</li>
        <li>Patient will maintain adequate hydration and nutritional intake/stable body weight.</li>
      </ul>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="interventions" label="Nursing Interventions">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Assess:</strong> Assess swallowing ability before, during, and after meals. Observe for signs of dysphagia (coughing, choking, throat clearing, wet voice, pocketing food). Monitor respiratory status, especially lung sounds. Monitor weight regularly. Assess patient's ability to self-feed (tremor, bradykinesia can interfere).</li>
        <li><strong>Safe Swallowing Techniques:</strong> Position patient fully upright (90 degrees) for all meals and for 30-60 minutes afterward. Remind patient to tuck chin toward chest when swallowing. Encourage smaller bites and slower eating pace. Minimize distractions during meals.</li>
        <li><strong>Diet Modification:</strong> Collaborate with Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) and Dietitian. Provide prescribed diet consistency (e.g., pureed, mechanical soft) and thickened liquids as recommended by SLP. Ensure adequate hydration.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Feeding Assistance:</strong> Provide adaptive utensils (e.g., weighted utensils, built-up handles, plate guards) as needed â€“ consult Occupational Therapy (OT). Provide assistance with feeding if necessary, allowing ample time.</li>
        <li><strong>Oral Hygiene:</strong> Provide thorough oral care before and after meals to reduce bacterial load in the mouth.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication Timing:</strong> Administer anti-Parkinson's medications 30-60 minutes <strong>before</strong> meals to optimize muscle control for chewing and swallowing.</li>
      </ul>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="rationale" label="Rationale">
      <p>Assessment identifies risk and guides interventions. Proper positioning uses gravity to aid swallowing. Specific techniques improve swallow safety.

### Important Considerations for Parkinson's Disease

* **Medication Management:** Emphasize the critical importance of adhering to the prescribed medication schedule (especially levodopa preparations) to manage motor fluctuations ("on-off" periods). Educate patient/family thoroughly on timing, dose, and potential side effects.
* **Multidisciplinary Team:** Effective management requires collaboration with neurologists, PT, OT, SLP, dietitians, social workers, mental health professionals, and pharmacists.
* **Non-Motor Symptoms:** Be vigilant in assessing and addressing non-motor symptoms (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, sleep disturbances, pain, cognitive changes), as these significantly impact quality of life.
* **Progression:** PD is progressive; the care plan needs regular reassessment and modification as the patient's condition changes.
* **Caregiver Support:** Recognize and address the needs and potential strain on caregivers. Provide resources and support for them as well.
* **Advance Care Planning:** Encourage discussion and documentation of advance directives and future care preferences as the disease progresses.
* **Date:** This care plan framework is current as of April 20, 2025. Specific assessments and interventions must be based on the patient's status at the time of care.

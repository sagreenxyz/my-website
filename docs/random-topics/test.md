# Pathophysiology of Neoplasias

## Section 1 - Physiology Review

*   **Basic Terminology:**
    *   **Cancer:** The unregulated growth of abnormal cells.
    *   **Neoplasia:** Term for new growth.
    *   **Neoplasm:** The new growth itself (tumor).
        *   Serves no biological purpose for the host.

*   **Core Cellular Processes & Cancer Alterations:**
    *   **Cell Cycle:** The process by which a cell duplicates its genetic information and then divides into two genetically identical daughter cells.
        *   Consists of 4 distinct phases:
            *   **G1 (Gap 1):** DNA synthesis stops; RNA and protein synthesis begin. Cell growth occurs.
            *   **S (Synthesis):** DNA synthesis occurs, resulting in two separate sets of identical chromosomes (one for each daughter cell).
            *   **G2 (Gap 2):** DNA synthesis ends; RNA and protein synthesis continue. Preparation for mitosis.
            *   **M (Mitosis):** Nuclear division (mitosis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis) occur, resulting in two daughter cells.
        *   **G0 Phase (Resting State):** Cells exit the cycle and are quiescent (not actively dividing or preparing to divide).
            *   Entered due to nutrient depletion, lack of growth factors, or upon reaching a highly specialized state.
            *   **Terminally Differentiated Cells:** Highly specialized cells (e.g., neurons) that permanently exit the cell cycle and remain in G0.
            *   Highly specialized cells in G0 are less likely to form cancers, as cancer involves uncontrolled proliferation of less specialized cells.
        *   **Interphase:** The collective term for the G1, S, and G2 phases, during which the cell grows and prepares for division.
        *   **Checkpoints:** Molecular surveillance points at the end of G1, S, and G2 phases ensure the process is acceptable to proceed. They check for DNA damage, proper chromosome duplication, and readiness for division.
    *   **Proliferation:**
        *   *Normal:* The process of increasing cell numbers by mitotic cell division.
            *   In normal tissues, cell production balances cell loss (death/shedding), maintaining tissue homeostasis.
            *   Triggered by signals like blood loss or tissue injury.
            *   **Cell Types:** Human cells include gametes (haploid: ovum, sperm) and somatic cells (diploid: all other body cells formed after fertilization). Cancer primarily involves somatic cells.
            *   **Groups of Proliferating Somatic Cells:**
                1.  **Well-differentiated:** Rarely divide/reproduce (e.g., neurons, skeletal/cardiac muscle cells). Typically remain in G0. Populations rely on progenitor cells for replenishment.
                2.  **Progenitor/Parent Cells:** Continue to divide/reproduce as needed (e.g., blood, skin, liver cells). They are sufficiently differentiated to produce daughter cells of a specific lineage but not yet fully specialized like mature cells. They replenish populations of specialized cells that cannot divide.
                3.  **Undifferentiated Stem Cells:** Remain incompletely differentiated and dormant until needed. Possess two important properties:
                    *   **Self-Renewal:** Can undergo numerous mitotic divisions while maintaining an undifferentiated state.
                    *   **Potency:** Describes the differentiation potential. Types include:
                        *   **Pluripotent ('Master Cells'):** Can differentiate into any cell type.
                        *   **Multipotent:** Can differentiate into a few select cell types.
                        *   **Unipotent:** Restricted to a single cell type but retain self-renewal.
                    *   **Main Types:**
                        1.  **Embryonic Stem Cells:** Play a major role in the developing embryo, giving rise to the three main germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm) which develop into all organ systems.
                        2.  **Adult Stem Cells:** Have significant roles in homeostasis, contributing to tissue regeneration and replacement of cells lost to apoptosis.
                    *   When needed, they divide. One daughter cell retains stem cell characteristics (self-renewal), while the other becomes a progenitor cell that differentiates towards a specific lineage, eventually reaching terminal differentiation.
                    *   This process allows for the production of large numbers of progenitor cells capable of carrying out required functions. (See Figure 2.2 for basic mechanism).
        *   *Cancer:* Uncontrolled proliferation; the balance between cell production and loss is disrupted, leading to excessive cell accumulation. Cells divide excessively and ignore normal stop signals.
    *   **Differentiation:**
        *   *Normal:* The process by which cells become more specialized in structure and function.
            *   All body cell types originate from the fertilized ovum.
            *   Differentiation is influenced by specific genes, gene expression patterns, and various chemical/environmental stimuli.
            *   The resulting adult cell has specific characteristics related to its composition, function, and lifespan (turnover rate).
            *   *Example:* Generalized blood-forming cells in bone marrow differentiate into specialized red blood cells (concave disks, oxygen transport, ~3-month lifespan).
            *   **Control:** The rate of cellular reproduction and differentiation must be precisely controlled (prenatally and postnatally) so both processes stop once the appropriate number and type of cells are formed.
            *   **Progressive Specialization:** As differentiation progresses, the process is tightly regulated within each developing cell type.
            *   **Loss of Potential:** As cells become more specialized, they lose the ability to develop characteristics of other cell types ("lineage commitment" or being "locked in").
            *   **Tissue Integrity:** This ensures the integrity and composition of developing organs are maintained, preventing unwanted cell types (e.g., preventing potential cardiac cells from becoming kidney cells).
        *   *Cancer:* Altered or lost differentiation (anaplasia); cells may resemble immature or primitive cell types.
    *   **Apoptosis:**
        *   *Normal:* Programmed cell death to eliminate old, damaged, or unnecessary cells. Tightly regulated.
        *   *Cancer:* Evasion of apoptosis; cancer cells resist programmed cell death, contributing to accumulation.

*   **Regulation of Normal Cell Growth:**
    *   Growth is controlled by a balance of signals.
    *   **Proto-oncogenes:** Encode proteins that promote cell proliferation (like a gas pedal). Tightly regulated.
    *   **Tumor Suppressor Genes:** Encode proteins that inhibit cell growth and signal for apoptosis (like brakes); they can initiate apoptotic events to eliminate potential tumor cells.
    *   **Dysregulation Impact:** Since these genes regulate either the initiation of cell growth (proto-oncogenes) or cell death (tumor suppressor genes), dysregulation in either can lead to unregulated growths and ultimately cancer.

*   **Cancer Statistics (US):**
    *   **Most Common Overall:** Skin cancers.
    *   **Most Common in Males:** Prostate cancer.
    *   **Most Common in Women:** Breast cancer.
    *   **Highest Mortality:** Lung cancer.

*   **Overall Physiological Control:** The tightly regulated processes of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in healthy individuals ensure tissue homeostasis and prevent the tissue disruption that would result from uncontrolled neoplastic growth.
*   **Importance of Regulation:** Normal cellular function relies on critical regulatory mechanisms (e.g., balance of proto-oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes, cell cycle checkpoints). Failure or dysregulation of these controls is fundamental to the development of cancer.

*   **Summary: Link to Cancer Pathogenesis:**
    *   Cancer develops when the normal physiological balance of cell growth, differentiation, and death is disrupted, typically due to genetic and/or epigenetic alterations.
    *   Key pathogenic events include:
        *   **Activation of Proto-oncogenes** into oncogenes, providing constant "go" signals for proliferation.
        *   **Inactivation of Tumor Suppressor Genes**, removing the "stop" signals for proliferation and the triggers for apoptosis in damaged cells.
        *   **Failure of Cell Cycle Checkpoints**, allowing cells with DNA damage or errors to continue dividing.
        *   **Evasion of Apoptosis**, enabling abnormal cells to survive and accumulate.
        *   **Loss of Normal Differentiation (Anaplasia)**, resulting in cells that do not perform their intended functions and often resemble primitive cell types; this can destroy adjacent tissues, rendering them incompetent.
    *   These disruptions lead to the characteristic uncontrolled proliferation, lack of differentiation, and resistance to death seen in neoplasms.

## Section 2 - Cancer Terminology

*   **Oncology:** The study/science of neoplasms (from Greek *onkos*: "swelling"). A **Clinical Oncologist** diagnoses and treats neoplasms.
*   **Neoplasm vs. Tumor:**
    *   **Neoplasm:** The proper term for a new, abnormal growth of cells, serving no biological purpose.
    *   **Tumor:** Commonly used for a cancerous mass, but can also refer to swelling from inflammation/trauma. Neoplasm specifically means the *new cell growth*.
*   **Major Classifications:** Neoplasms are broadly classified as Benign or Malignant based on cell characteristics, growth rate/manner, and potential to invade/metastasize/cause death.
    1.  **Benign Neoplasms:**
        *   **Cells:** Well-differentiated; resemble cells of the tissue of origin.
        *   **Growth Rate:** Slow, progressive.
        *   **Mode of Growth:** Expansion; remain localized to the site of origin.
        *   **Capsule:** Often develop a fibrous capsule (rim of connective tissue).
        *   **Metastasis:** Not capable of metastasizing.
        *   **Threat Level:** Generally less threatening unless they interfere with vital functions (e.g., brain compression) or other functions (e.g., compressing blood vessels/nerves, abnormal hormone production).
        *   **Removal:** Capsule aids in surgical removal.
    2.  **Malignant Neoplasms (Cancers):**
        *   **Cells:** Undifferentiated (anaplastic) with atypical structure.
        *   **Growth Rate:** Variable; often rapid, especially with less differentiation.
        *   **Mode of Growth:** Invasion; infiltrates surrounding tissues.
        *   **Margins:** Lack well-defined margins or a fibrous capsule.
            *   *Clinical Note:* Because there is no capsule, margins of excised (biopsied) tumors must be examined microscopically to ensure they are free of cancer cells, helping confirm complete removal. Surgical removal also risks disrupting the tumor, potentially causing shedding and redepositing of cancer cells in new locations.
        *   **Metastasis:** Capable of spreading (metastasizing) via blood and lymph systems.
        *   **Local Effects:** Can compress blood vessels, outgrow their blood supply causing ischemia/tissue injury.
        *   **Systemic Effects:** Some secrete hormones, liberate toxins, or elicit inflammatory responses.
        *   **Angiogenesis:** Many secrete Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) to stimulate new blood vessel growth, increasing blood supply and facilitating rapid growth.
        *   **Broad Categories:**
            1.  **Solid Tumors:** Initially confined to a specific tissue/organ. Cells can detach, invade surrounding tissue, and metastasize via blood/lymph systems.
            2.  **Hematologic Cancers:** Involve cells normally found in blood and lymph, meaning they are inherently disseminated throughout the body from the beginning.

*   **Comparison Summary Table:**

    | Characteristics        | Benign                                                              | Malignant                                                                      |

*   **Tumor Nomenclature:**
    *   **General Rule:** Tumors are often named by adding the suffix "-oma" to the tissue type from which the growth originates. (See Table 2.2).
    *   **Specific Terms & Examples:**
        *   **Adenoma:** Benign tumor of glandular epithelial tissues.

        *   **Polyp:** A growth projecting from a mucosal surface (e.g., intestine). Can be benign or malignant.
        *   **Carcinoma in situ:** A localized, pre-invasive epithelial lesion where cells have not crossed the basement membrane. Often curable with removal (e.g., cervical, breast ductal).
    *   **Nomenclature Examples by Tissue Type (Table 2.2):**

## Section 3 - Cancer Cell Characteristics

*   **Abnormal and Rapid Proliferation:** Cancer cells divide excessively and uncontrollably, ignoring normal signals that regulate cell division and growth.
*   **Loss of Differentiation (Anaplasia):**
    *   Meaning "to form backward," anaplasia describes the loss of cell differentiation in cancerous tissue.
    *   Cancer cells lose the specialized structures and functions of the normal cells from which they originated.
    *   **Morphological Changes:** Undifferentiated cancer cells display:
        *   **Pleomorphism:** Variations in the size and shape of both cells and nuclei.
        *   **Nuclear Abnormalities:** Coarse and clumped chromatin, larger nucleoli, abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy).
        *   **Increased Mitosis:** A higher number of cells undergoing mitosis due to rapid proliferation.
        *   **Primitive Appearance:** Highly anaplastic cells resemble undifferentiated or embryonic cells more than their tissue of origin.
    *   **Tumor Grading:** A system (typically scale I to IV) used to classify tumors based on the degree of differentiation and proliferation rate.
        *   **Grade I:** Well-differentiated (cells closely resemble normal tissue cells).
        *   **Grade IV:** Poorly differentiated or anaplastic (cells show marked pleomorphism and lack resemblance to normal tissue).
        *   The closer the resemblance to normal tissue (morphologically and functionally), the lower the grade.
*   **Genetic Instability:**
    *   Considered a hallmark of cancer. Normal cells have mechanisms to prevent genetic errors.
    *   Cancer's dysregulated nature leads to a high frequency of mutations and chromosomal alterations, increasing genetic instability.
    *   This instability promotes cancer development and progression.
    *   **Types of Genetic Errors:**
        *   **Aneuploidy:** Gain or loss of chromosomes.
        *   **Intrachromosomal Instability:** Insertions, deletions, amplifications within chromosomes.
        *   **Microsatellite Instability:** Changes in short, repetitive DNA sequences.
        *   **Point Mutations:** Alterations affecting single nucleotides.
*   **Growth Factor Independence:**
    *   Cancer cells can proliferate even without external growth factors.
    *   Normal cells require growth factors to grow (e.g., in cell culture).
    *   Cancer cells may:
        *   Produce their own growth factors (autocrine signaling).
        *   Have abnormal receptors or signaling proteins that inappropriately activate growth pathways even without growth factor binding.
*   **Loss of Cell Density-Dependent Inhibition (Contact Inhibition):**
    *   Normal cells stop proliferating once they reach a certain density or make contact with neighboring cells (contact inhibition).
    *   Cancer cells often lose this inhibition and continue to grow rampantly without regard for adjacent tissue density.
    *   *Example:* In normal wound healing, cell growth stops when the wound edges meet due to contact inhibition. Cancer cells would continue growing past this point.
*   **Loss of Cell Cohesiveness and Adhesion:**
    *   Cancer cells often lose the tendency to stick together (reduced cohesiveness and adhesion).
    *   This permits surface cells of the tumor to shed easily into surrounding body fluids or secretions, facilitating spread.
*   **Loss of Anchorage Dependence:**
    *   Normal epithelial cells require attachment to neighboring cells or the extracellular matrix to survive and grow (anchorage dependence).
    *   Detached normal cells undergo apoptosis (specifically, *anoikis* - Greek for "homeless").
    *   Cancer cells often lose this dependence, allowing them to remain viable and multiply even when detached.
*   **Diminished Cell-to-Cell Communication:**
    *   Cancer cells show reduced communication with neighboring cells.
    *   This interferes with intercellular connections and responsiveness to membrane-derived signals.
    *   *Example:* Some cancers have altered gap junction proteins, impairing communication pathways.
*   **Unlimited Life Span (Immortality):**
    *   Normal cells have a limited number of divisions before they senesce (fail to divide further).
    *   Cancer cells can divide an infinite number of times, achieving immortality.
    *   **Mechanism:** Normal cells' telomeres (protective chromosome end-caps) shorten with each division, limiting lifespan. Most cancer cells maintain high levels of **telomerase**, an enzyme that prevents telomere shortening.
    *   This allows older, potentially more error-prone cells to continue replicating, leading to increasingly dysfunctional cell populations.
*   **Antigen Expression:**
    *   Cancer cells express cell surface molecules (antigens) that are immunologically different from their normal tissue counterparts.
    *   They often revert to embryonic patterns of gene expression, producing antigens different from the original tissue.
    *   **Clinical Utility:** These tumor antigens serve as useful identification markers. Their presence can indicate the existence, recurrence, or progression of cancer.
*   **Production of Enzymes, Hormones, and Other Substances:**
    *   Cancer cells can produce substances (enzymes, hormones) in amounts or types not typical for the tissue of origin.
    *   They may overcome normal restrictions on production.
    *   Some secreted substances (e.g., certain enzymes) can facilitate invasion and metastasis.
*   **Cytoskeletal Changes or Abnormalities:**
    *   Cancer cells exhibit changes in their cytoskeleton (e.g., abnormal intermediate filament types, changes in actin filaments and microtubules).
    *   These alterations can enhance their ability to invade tissues and metastasize.

*   **Tumor Growth and Spread:**
    *   **Mechanisms:** Unlike benign tumors (expansion, often encapsulated), cancer spreads via:
        1.  **Direct Invasion and Extension:**
            *   Cancer spreads into surrounding tissues with "crablike" projections (Latin *cancer* = crab).
            *   Lacks a clear line of demarcation, making surgical removal difficult.
            *   Surgeons remove tissue margins beyond the visible tumor. Pathologists examine these margins to ensure they are cancer-free, indicating complete removal.
        2.  **Seeding:**
            *   Shed tumor cells enter circulation or body cavities.
            *   Commonly occurs in the peritoneal cavity (e.g., ovarian cancer), often leading to fluid accumulation (ascites). Can also occur in pleural spaces (pleural effusion).
            *   Can be an iatrogenic complication of surgery, where disturbed cancer cells migrate to new locations.
        3.  **Metastasis:**
            *   Development of a secondary tumor distant from the primary tumor.
            *   **Multi-step Process:**
                1.  A cancer cell breaks loose from the primary tumor.
                2.  Invades the surrounding extracellular matrix.
                3.  Gains access to a blood vessel (intravasation).
                4.  Survives passage in the bloodstream (evading immune detection/destruction).
                5.  Emerges from the bloodstream at a favorable location (extravasation).
                6.  Invades the surrounding tissue.
                7.  Begins to grow (proliferation).
                8.  Establishes a blood supply (**angiogenesis** - the development of new blood vessels within the tumor) and secures necessary growth factors to sustain growth.
            *   **Factors Influencing Growth Rate (Post-Angiogenesis):** Once cells establish an adequate blood supply, the rate of tissue growth (normal or cancerous) depends on:
                1.  The number of cells actively dividing or moving through the cell cycle.
                2.  The duration of the cell cycle.
                3.  The number of cells being lost relative to the number produced.
                *   *Note:* Recent studies suggest cancer cells cycle at approximately the same rate as normal cells, implying that the increased tumor mass is primarily due to excessive proliferation (more cells dividing) and reduced cell loss (evasion of apoptosis), rather than a faster cell cycle. Because cancer cells have a prolonged lifespan and seldom enter G0, there is a greater percentage of cancer cells actively dividing relative to normal cells.
            *   **Key Growth Rate Terms:**
                1.  **Growth Fraction:** The ratio of dividing cells (cells currently in the cell cycle) to resting cells (cells in G0).
                2.  **Doubling Time:** The length of time it takes for the total mass of cells in a tumor to double.
            *   Metastatic (secondary) tumors often retain characteristics of the primary tumor, aiding in identifying the origin.
            *   Timing varies; some cancers metastasize early, others late.
            *   Occasionally, the metastasis is found before the primary tumor (e.g., asymptomatic kidney cancer found via lung metastasis).
    *   **Metastatic Pathways:**
        *   **Lymphatic Spread:**
            *   Cancer cells travel via lymph channels.
            *   Often, the first evidence is in lymph nodes draining the tumor area.
            *   **Sentinel Node:** The initial lymph node receiving drainage from the primary tumor.
            *   **Clinical Relevance:** Lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy (using dye/tracer) help determine the extent of spread, crucial in cancers like breast cancer. Presence of cancer cells in the sentinel node indicates lymphatic spread.
        *   **Hematologic (Blood Vessel) Spread:**
            *   Cancer cells enter venous blood draining the primary site.
            *   **Liver Metastasis:** Common for cancers originating in the GI tract, pancreas, and spleen, as their venous blood flows through the portal vein to the liver.
            *   **Site Preference:** Some cancers preferentially metastasize to specific distant sites, likely due to favorable microenvironments (e.g., prostate cancer often spreads to bone).

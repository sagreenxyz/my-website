# Joints (Articulations): Connecting Bones and Enabling Movement

**Module 1: Introduction to Joints**

Defining Joints (Articulations):
* What is a joint, or articulation?
* What are the primary functions of joints in the skeletal system?

Classification of Joints:
* Describe the two main ways joints are classified:
    * Structural Classification: Based on the material binding the bones together and the presence or absence of a joint cavity.
    * Functional Classification: Based on the amount of movement allowed at the joint.

**Module 2: Structural Classification of Joints**

Fibrous Joints:
* Describe the general characteristics of fibrous joints.
* List and describe the three types of fibrous joints, providing examples of each:
    * Sutures
    * Syndesmoses
    * Gomphoses

Cartilaginous Joints:
* Describe the general characteristics of cartilaginous joints.
* List and describe the two types of cartilaginous joints, providing examples of each:
    * Synchondroses
    * Symphyses

Synovial Joints:
* Describe the general characteristics of synovial joints.
* List the key features of a synovial joint:
    * Articular Cartilage
    * Joint (Synovial) Cavity
    * Synovial Fluid
    * Articular Capsule (Fibrous Layer and Synovial Membrane)
    * Reinforcing Ligaments

**Module 3: Functional Classification of Joints**

Synarthroses:
* Define synarthroses.
* What is the degree of movement allowed at these joints?
* Provide examples of synarthrotic joints.

Amphiarthroses:
* Define amphiarthroses.
* What is the degree of movement allowed at these joints?
* Provide examples of amphiarthrotic joints.

Diarthroses:
* Define diarthroses.
* What is the degree of movement allowed at these joints?
* All synovial joints are functionally classified as what?

**Module 4: Synovial Joints - Types Based on Movement**

Plane Joints:
* Describe the shape of the articular surfaces and the type of movement allowed. Provide examples.

Hinge Joints:
* Describe the shape of the articular surfaces and the type of movement allowed. Provide examples.

Pivot Joints:
* Describe the shape of the articular surfaces and the type of movement allowed. Provide examples.

Condylar (Ellipsoidal) Joints:
* Describe the shape of the articular surfaces and the type of movement allowed. Provide examples.

Saddle Joints:
* Describe the shape of the articular surfaces and the type of movement allowed. Provide examples.

Ball-and-Socket Joints:
* Describe the shape of the articular surfaces and the type of movement allowed. Provide examples.

**Module 5: Movements Allowed at Synovial Joints**

Gliding Movements:
* Describe gliding movements.

Angular Movements:
* Define and provide examples of:
    * Flexion
    * Extension
    * Hyperextension
    * Abduction
    * Adduction
    * Circumduction

Rotational Movements:
* Define and provide examples of:
    * Medial (Internal) Rotation
    * Lateral (External) Rotation

Special Movements:
* Define and provide examples of:
    * Dorsiflexion and Plantar Flexion
    * Inversion and Eversion
    * Protraction and Retraction
    * Elevation and Depression
    * Opposition
    * Supination and Pronation

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Joint Disorders and Function**

Common Joint Injuries:
* Briefly describe examples of common joint injuries (e.g., sprains, dislocations, cartilage tears).

Arthritis:
* Briefly describe the two main types of arthritis:
    * Osteoarthritis
    * Rheumatoid Arthritis

Joint Replacement:
* Briefly explain the concept of joint replacement surgery.

Pharmacological Management of Joint Disorders:
* Provide examples of drugs used to treat joint pain and inflammation (e.g., NSAIDs, corticosteroids).

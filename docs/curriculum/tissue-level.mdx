# Tissue Level of Organization

**Module 1: Introduction to Tissues**

Defining a Tissue:
* What is a tissue in the context of biological organization?
* Explain how cells and extracellular matrix contribute to the structure and function of tissues.
* What are the four primary types of tissues found in the human body?

Overview of Tissue Functions:
* Briefly describe the general functions associated with each of the four main tissue types:
    * Epithelial tissue
    * Connective tissue
    * Muscle tissue
    * Nervous tissue

**Module 2: Epithelial Tissue**

General Characteristics of Epithelial Tissue:
* List and describe the common characteristics of epithelial tissues (e.g., cellularity, specialized contacts, polarity, support by connective tissue, avascular but innervated, regeneration).
* What are the main functions of epithelial tissue?

Classification of Covering and Lining Epithelia:
* Explain the two criteria used to classify covering and lining epithelia (cell shape and number of cell layers).
* Describe the different types of covering and lining epithelia, providing examples of where each type is found and its specific function:
    * Simple squamous epithelium
    * Simple cuboidal epithelium
    * Simple columnar epithelium
    * Pseudostratified columnar epithelium
    * Stratified squamous epithelium (keratinized and nonkeratinized)
    * Stratified cuboidal epithelium
    * Stratified columnar epithelium
    * Transitional epithelium

Glandular Epithelium:
* What is glandular epithelium?
* Distinguish between exocrine and endocrine glands based on their structure and mode of secretion.
* Provide examples of different types of exocrine glands (e.g., merocrine, apocrine, holocrine) and endocrine glands, along with the substances they secrete.

**Module 3: Connective Tissue**

General Characteristics of Connective Tissue:
* List and describe the common characteristics of connective tissues (e.g., common embryonic origin, varying degrees of vascularity, extracellular matrix).
* What are the main functions of connective tissue?

Components of Connective Tissue:
* Describe the two main components of the extracellular matrix: ground substance and fibers (collagen, elastic, reticular).
* Identify the major cell types found in different types of connective tissue and their functions (e.g., fibroblasts, chondrocytes, osteocytes, hematopoietic stem cells).

Classification of Connective Tissue Proper:
* Describe the structure, function, and locations of the following types of connective tissue proper:
    * Loose connective tissues (areolar, adipose, reticular)
    * Dense connective tissues (dense regular, dense irregular, elastic)

Specialized Connective Tissues:
* Describe the structure, function, and locations of the following specialized connective tissues:
    * Cartilage (hyaline, elastic, fibrocartilage)
    * Bone (compact and spongy)
    * Blood

**Module 4: Muscle Tissue**

General Characteristics of Muscle Tissue:
* List and describe the common characteristics of muscle tissue (e.g., excitability, contractility, extensibility, elasticity).
* What is the primary function of muscle tissue?

Types of Muscle Tissue:
* Compare and contrast the three types of muscle tissue (skeletal, cardiac, smooth) in terms of:
    * Structure of muscle cells
    * Location in the body
    * Control of contraction (voluntary/involuntary)
    * Presence of striations

**Module 5: Nervous Tissue**

General Characteristics of Nervous Tissue:
* What is the primary function of nervous tissue?
* What are the two main types of cells found in nervous tissue?

Neurons: The Conducting Cells:
* Describe the structure of a typical neuron, including the cell body (soma), dendrites, axon, and axon terminals.
* Explain the basic function of neurons in generating and transmitting nerve impulses.

Neuroglia: The Supporting Cells:
* List the different types of neuroglia in the central and peripheral nervous systems and describe their specific functions.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance: Tissue Disorders and Therapies**

Tissue Damage and Repair:
* Describe the general processes of tissue repair (inflammation, organization, regeneration and fibrosis).
* Explain how different tissue types have varying capacities for repair.

Common Tissue Pathologies:
* Briefly describe the causes, symptoms, and basic treatment approaches for common disorders affecting different tissue types, such as:
    * Epithelial: Skin infections, carcinomas
    * Connective: Arthritis, osteoporosis, connective tissue diseases (e.g., lupus)
    * Muscle: Muscle strains, muscular dystrophy
    * Nervous: Multiple sclerosis, neuropathies

Pharmacological Interventions Targeting Tissues:
* Discuss how various drugs are designed to target specific tissues and their components. Provide examples of medications used to treat conditions affecting:
    * Inflammation in connective tissues (e.g., NSAIDs, corticosteroids)
    * Muscle spasms (e.g., muscle relaxants)
    * Nerve pain (e.g., anticonvulsants, antidepressants)
    * Abnormal cell growth in epithelial tissues (e.g., chemotherapy)
* Explain the importance of understanding tissue structure and function in developing tissue-specific therapies.

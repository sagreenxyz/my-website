# Autosomal Dominant Inheritance

**Module 1: Introduction to Autosomal Dominant Inheritance**

Defining Autosomal Dominant Inheritance:
* What does "autosomal" mean in the context of inheritance?
* What does "dominant" mean in the context of alleles and phenotype expression?
* In autosomal dominant inheritance, how many copies of the dominant allele are needed for the trait to be expressed?

Key Characteristics:
* List the key characteristics that often indicate an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance in pedigrees.

**Module 2: Genotypes and Phenotypes in Autosomal Dominant Inheritance**

Dominant Allele (A) and Recessive Allele (a):
* Explain the possible genotypes for an autosomal dominant trait (AA, Aa, aa).
* Which genotypes will express the dominant phenotype?
* Which genotype will express the recessive phenotype?

Homozygous Dominant (AA):
* Describe the phenotype of an individual with a homozygous dominant genotype.
* What is the probability of passing on the dominant allele to offspring?

Heterozygous (Aa):
* Describe the phenotype of an individual with a heterozygous genotype.
* What is the probability of passing on the dominant or recessive allele to offspring?

Homozygous Recessive (aa):
* Describe the phenotype of an individual with a homozygous recessive genotype.
* What is the probability of passing on the recessive allele to offspring?

**Module 3: Pedigree Analysis of Autosomal Dominant Traits**

Identifying Autosomal Dominant Patterns:
* Explain how to recognize an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in a pedigree.
* What are some typical features to look for (e.g., affected individuals in every generation, affected individuals with at least one affected parent)?

Example Pedigree Analysis:
* Analyze a sample pedigree illustrating autosomal dominant inheritance, tracing the transmission of the trait through multiple generations.
* Determine the possible genotypes of individuals in the pedigree based on their phenotypes and family history.

**Module 4: Examples of Autosomal Dominant Disorders**

Huntington's Disease:
* Briefly describe Huntington's disease and its inheritance pattern.

Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1):
* Briefly describe NF1 and its inheritance pattern.

Marfan Syndrome:
* Briefly describe Marfan Syndrome and its inheritance pattern.

Achondroplasia:
* Briefly describe achondroplasia and its inheritance pattern.

**Module 5: Penetrance and Expressivity in Autosomal Dominant Traits**

Penetrance:
* Define penetrance and explain the concept of incomplete penetrance in autosomal dominant disorders.
* How can an individual with the dominant allele not express the trait?

Expressivity:
* Define expressivity and explain how the severity of the phenotype can vary among individuals with the same autosomal dominant genotype.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance: Autosomal Dominant Disorders**

Diagnosis and Genetic Testing:
* Briefly discuss how autosomal dominant disorders are diagnosed, including the role of genetic testing.

Genetic Counseling:
* Explain the importance of genetic counseling for individuals and families affected by autosomal dominant disorders, including risk assessment for offspring.

Management and Treatment:
* Briefly mention the general approaches to managing autosomal dominant disorders.

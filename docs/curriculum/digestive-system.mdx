# The Digestive System: Processing Food and Absorbing Nutrients

**Module 1: Introduction to the Digestive System**

Defining the Digestive System:
* What are the primary functions of the digestive system?
* List the major organs and accessory structures of the digestive system.
* Differentiate between mechanical and chemical digestion.

**Module 2: Anatomy of the Oral Cavity, Pharynx, and Esophagus**

Oral Cavity:
* Describe the structure and functions of the mouth, including the tongue, teeth, and salivary glands.
* Explain the processes of mastication and salivation.

Pharynx:
* Briefly review the three regions of the pharynx and their role in deglutition (swallowing).

Esophagus:
* Describe the structure of the esophagus and its function in transporting food to the stomach.
* Explain the process of peristalsis.

**Module 3: Anatomy and Physiology of the Stomach**

Structure of the Stomach:
* Describe the gross anatomy of the stomach (regions, curvatures, folds).
* Identify the cell types in the gastric glands and their secretions.

Functions of the Stomach:
* Explain the mechanical digestion that occurs in the stomach.
* Describe the chemical digestion of proteins initiated in the stomach.
* What is chyme?

Regulation of Gastric Secretion and Motility:
* Briefly discuss the neural and hormonal control of gastric activity.

**Module 4: Anatomy and Physiology of the Small Intestine**

Structure of the Small Intestine:
* Describe the three regions of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum).
* Describe the structural adaptations that increase surface area for absorption (circular folds, villi, microvilli).
* Identify the major enzymes and secretions that act in the small intestine.

Functions of the Small Intestine:
* Explain the chemical digestion of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in the small intestine.
* Describe the absorption of nutrients, water, and electrolytes.

Regulation of Small Intestinal Secretion and Motility:
* Briefly discuss the neural and hormonal control of small intestinal activity.

**Module 5: Anatomy and Physiology of the Large Intestine**

Structure of the Large Intestine:
* Describe the gross anatomy of the large intestine (regions, features).
* How does its structure differ from the small intestine?

Functions of the Large Intestine:
* Explain the absorption of water and electrolytes in the large intestine.
* Describe the formation and elimination of feces.
* What is the role of gut microbiota?

Regulation of Large Intestinal Motility:
* Briefly discuss the neural and hormonal control of large intestinal activity.

**Module 6: Accessory Digestive Organs**

Liver:
* Describe the structure and major functions of the liver, including bile production.

Gallbladder:
* Describe the structure and function of the gallbladder in storing and concentrating bile.

Pancreas (Exocrine Function):
* Describe the exocrine function of the pancreas and the composition of pancreatic juice.

Regulation of Accessory Organ Secretions:
* Briefly discuss the hormonal control of bile and pancreatic juice release.

**Module 7: Clinical Relevance - Digestive Disorders and Pharmacology**

Common Digestive Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common digestive disorders (e.g., GERD, ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease, gallstones, pancreatitis).

Malabsorption Syndromes:
* Briefly discuss conditions affecting nutrient absorption.

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Provide examples of drugs used to treat digestive disorders (e.g., antacids, proton pump inhibitors, antiemetics, laxatives).

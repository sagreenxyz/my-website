* What are the primary functions of the axial muscles?

Organization of the Axial Muscles:
* Briefly list the major groups of axial muscles.

**Module 2: Muscles of the Head and Neck**

Facial Expression:
* Describe the locations and actions of the major muscles of facial expression.

Mastication (Chewing):
* Name the primary muscles involved in mastication and describe their actions.

Tongue Movement:
* Briefly mention the muscles responsible for tongue movement.

Pharynx and Swallowing:
* Briefly mention the muscles involved in swallowing.

Neck Muscles:
* Describe the locations and actions of the major muscles of the neck, including those involved in head movement and support.

**Module 3: Muscles of the Vertebral Column**

Erector Spinae:
* Describe the three columns of the erector spinae muscles (iliocostalis, longissimus, spinalis) and their overall actions.

Deep Muscles of the Back:
* Briefly mention other deep muscles of the back and their roles in vertebral movement and stability.

Muscles of the Abdominal Wall:
* Name and describe the four main muscles of the abdominal wall (rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis) and their actions.

**Module 4: Muscles of Respiration**

Diaphragm:

Muscles of the Pelvic Diaphragm:
* Describe the main muscles forming the pelvic diaphragm (levator ani, coccygeus) and their functions.

Urogenital Diaphragm:
* Briefly mention the muscles of the urogenital diaphragm and their roles.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Axial Muscle Disorders and Function**

Common Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common disorders affecting axial muscles (e.g., back pain, neck pain, muscle strains, hernias).

Importance in Posture and Movement:
* Emphasize the crucial role of axial muscles in maintaining posture, stability, and trunk movement.

Pharmacological and Clinical Therapies:

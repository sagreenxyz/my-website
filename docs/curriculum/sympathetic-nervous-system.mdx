# The Sympathetic Nervous System: Preparing the Body for Action

**Module 1: Introduction to the Sympathetic Nervous System**

Defining the Sympathetic Division:
* What is the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS)?
* What is its general role in the body's response to stress or emergencies?
* It is often referred to as the "fight-or-flight" system. Explain why.

Overview of Sympathetic Functions:
* List the major physiological changes that occur when the sympathetic nervous system is activated.

**Module 2: Anatomical Features of the Sympathetic Division**

Origin of Preganglionic Neurons:
* Where in the central nervous system (CNS) do preganglionic sympathetic neurons originate? (thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord)

Sympathetic Trunk Ganglia:
* Describe the sympathetic trunk (chain) ganglia. Where are they located relative to the spinal cord?
* What are the three possible pathways of preganglionic fibers after entering the sympathetic trunk ganglia?

Prevertebral Ganglia:
* Describe the location of prevertebral ganglia (collateral ganglia) relative to the sympathetic trunk.
* Name the major prevertebral ganglia (celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric).

Pathways of Postganglionic Fibers:
* Explain how postganglionic sympathetic fibers reach their target organs.

**Module 3: Neurotransmitters and Receptors in the Sympathetic Division**

Preganglionic Neurons:
* What neurotransmitter is released by preganglionic sympathetic neurons?
* What type of receptor is found on postganglionic sympathetic neurons?

Postganglionic Neurons:
* What is the primary neurotransmitter released by most postganglionic sympathetic neurons?
* What are adrenergic receptors? List and briefly describe the main types (alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, beta-3) and their general effects.

Sympathetic Cholinergic Fibers:
* Explain the exception of sympathetic postganglionic fibers that innervate sweat glands and some blood vessels in skeletal muscles. What neurotransmitter do they release, and what type of receptor is involved?

**Module 4: Effects of Sympathetic Activation on Target Organs**

Cardiovascular System:
* Describe the effects of sympathetic stimulation on heart rate, contractility, and blood vessels (vasoconstriction/vasodilation).

Respiratory System:
* Describe the effects of sympathetic stimulation on bronchioles.

Digestive System:
* Describe the effects of sympathetic stimulation on digestive motility and secretions.

Urinary System:
* Describe the effects of sympathetic stimulation on bladder function.

Endocrine System:
* Describe the sympathetic stimulation of the adrenal medulla and the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine.

Other Organs:
* Briefly discuss sympathetic effects on the liver, adipose tissue, and pupils.

**Module 5: Control of the Sympathetic Division**

Integration Centers:
* Identify the main brain regions involved in regulating sympathetic activity (e.g., hypothalamus, brainstem reticular formation, cerebral cortex).

Reflex Pathways:
* Describe examples of sympathetic reflexes.

Influence of Higher Brain Centers:
* Explain how emotions and conscious thought can influence sympathetic activity.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Disorders and Pharmacology of the Sympathetic Division**

Disorders of Sympathetic Function:
* Briefly describe examples of disorders involving sympathetic dysfunction (e.g., Horner's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon).

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Provide examples of drugs that mimic or block sympathetic effects (sympathomimetics and sympatholytics/adrenergic antagonists) and their clinical uses.

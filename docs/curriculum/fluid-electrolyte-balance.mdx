# Fluid and Electrolyte Balance: Maintaining the Body's Internal Sea

**Module 1: Introduction to Fluid and Electrolyte Balance**

Defining Fluid Balance:
* What is fluid balance?
* What are the major fluid compartments in the body (intracellular fluid - ICF, extracellular fluid - ECF)?
* Describe the distribution of water within these compartments.

Defining Electrolyte Balance:
* What are electrolytes?
* List the major electrolytes in the body and their typical locations (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate).
* Why is maintaining electrolyte balance crucial?

**Module 2: Fluid Movement Between Compartments**

Osmosis and Water Movement:
* Explain the principle of osmosis and its role in water movement between fluid compartments.
* What is osmotic pressure?

Hydrostatic Pressure:
* Explain the role of hydrostatic pressure in fluid movement, particularly across capillary walls.

Regulation of Fluid Movement:
* Discuss the factors that regulate fluid movement between the ICF and ECF (osmotic gradients).
* Discuss the factors that regulate fluid movement between the plasma and interstitial fluid (hydrostatic and osmotic pressures at capillaries).

**Module 3: Electrolyte Balance - Regulation of Key Electrolytes**

Sodium Balance:
* Describe the regulation of sodium balance by aldosterone (kidney reabsorption) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (kidney excretion).
* What is the role of the thirst mechanism in sodium and water balance?

Potassium Balance:
* Describe the regulation of potassium balance by aldosterone (kidney secretion).
* Explain the importance of maintaining potassium balance for nerve and muscle function.

Calcium Balance:
* Briefly review the hormonal regulation of calcium balance (PTH, vitamin D, calcitonin). How do the kidneys contribute?

Other Electrolytes:
* Briefly mention the regulation of chloride and bicarbonate.

**Module 4: Water Intake and Output**

Sources of Water Intake:
* List the various sources of water intake (ingested liquids, ingested foods, metabolic water).

Routes of Water Output:
* List the various routes of water output (urine, insensible water loss - skin and lungs, sweat, feces).

Regulation of Water Intake and Output:
* Explain how thirst and hormonal mechanisms (ADH, aldosterone, ANP) regulate water balance.

**Module 5: Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances**

Dehydration:
* Define dehydration and list common causes.
* Describe the effects of dehydration on body fluids and function.

Overhydration (Water Intoxication):
* Define overhydration and list common causes.
* Describe the effects of overhydration on body fluids and function.

Electrolyte Imbalances:
* Briefly describe common imbalances of sodium (hypernatremia, hyponatremia), potassium (hyperkalemia, hypokalemia), and calcium (hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia) and their potential causes and effects.

**Module 6: Clinical Assessment and Management of Imbalances**

Assessing Fluid and Electrolyte Balance:
* Describe methods used to assess fluid balance (e.g., monitoring intake and output, daily weights, skin turgor, blood pressure).
* Describe methods used to assess electrolyte balance (blood electrolyte levels).

Management of Imbalances:
* Discuss general principles for managing fluid imbalances (fluid replacement, fluid restriction).
* Discuss general principles for managing electrolyte imbalances (electrolyte supplementation, medications to promote excretion).

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Provide examples of drugs that affect fluid and electrolyte balance (e.g., diuretics, IV fluids, electrolyte supplements).

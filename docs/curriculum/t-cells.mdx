# T Lymphocytes: Orchestrators of Cellular Immunity

**Module 1: Introduction to T Lymphocytes**

Defining T Lymphocytes (T Cells):
* What are T lymphocytes (T cells)?
* Where do they originate and mature?
* What is their primary role in adaptive immunity?
* How do they differ from B lymphocytes?

T Cell Receptors (TCRs):
* Describe the structure of a T cell receptor.
* How do TCRs recognize antigens? What is the role of MHC molecules?

**Module 2: Maturation and Selection of T Cells**

Thymic Education:
* Describe the process of T cell maturation in the thymus.
* What is positive selection and what does it ensure?
* What is negative selection and what does it ensure?
* What is the outcome of thymic education?

CD Markers:
* Explain the significance of CD (cluster of differentiation) markers on T cells.
* Differentiate between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

**Module 3: Major Types of T Cells and Their Functions**

Helper T Cells (CD4+):
* Describe the different subsets of helper T cells (Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg).
* Explain the primary functions of each subset and the cytokines they secrete.
* What is the overall role of helper T cells in adaptive immune responses?

Cytotoxic T Cells (CD8+):
* Explain how cytotoxic T cells recognize and kill infected or cancerous cells.
* What are the mechanisms of cytotoxic T cell-mediated killing (e.g., perforin, granzymes)?

Regulatory T Cells (Treg):
* Describe the role of regulatory T cells in suppressing immune responses and maintaining self-tolerance.

Memory T Cells:
* Explain the generation and function of memory T cells in the secondary immune response.

**Module 4: T Cell Activation**

Antigen Presentation to T Cells:
* Describe the role of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in presenting antigens to T cells on MHC molecules.
* What are the co-stimulatory signals required for full T cell activation?

Activation of Helper T Cells:
* Explain the activation of CD4+ T cells by MHC class II-antigen complexes on APCs.

Activation of Cytotoxic T Cells:
* Explain the activation of CD8+ T cells by MHC class I-antigen complexes on APCs.

**Module 5: T Cell Interactions with Other Immune Cells**

Helper T Cell Interaction with B Cells:
* Describe the role of helper T cells (Th2) in activating B cells for antibody production.

Helper T Cell Interaction with Macrophages:
* Describe the role of helper T cells (Th1) in activating macrophages for enhanced phagocytosis.

Cytotoxic T Cell Interaction with Target Cells:
* Explain how cytotoxic T cells recognize and interact with target cells displaying specific antigens on MHC class I.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - T Cell Disorders and Therapies**

T Cell Deficiencies:
* Briefly describe examples of primary and secondary T cell deficiencies (e.g., SCID, HIV/AIDS).

T Cell Involvement in Autoimmunity:
* Explain the role of autoreactive T cells in autoimmune diseases.

T Cell-Based Immunotherapies:
* Briefly mention examples of T cell-based cancer immunotherapies (e.g., CAR T-cell therapy).

T Cell Modulation in Transplantation:
* Discuss the importance of T cell regulation in transplant rejection and the use of immunosuppressants targeting T cells.

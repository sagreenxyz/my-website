# The Skeletal System: Support, Protection, and Movement

**Module 1: Introduction to the Skeletal System**

Defining the Skeletal System:
* What are the main components of the skeletal system?
* What are the primary functions of the skeletal system?

Organization of the Skeletal System:
* Describe the axial skeleton and its major bones.
* Describe the appendicular skeleton and its major bones.

**Module 2: Bone Classification and Structure**

Classification of Bones by Shape:
* Describe the five main classifications of bones based on shape (long, short, flat, irregular, sesamoid) and provide examples of each.

Gross Anatomy of Bones:
* Describe the general structure of a long bone.
* Briefly describe the structure of short, flat, and irregular bones.

Microscopic Anatomy of Bones:
* Describe the structure of compact bone (osteons).
* Describe the structure of spongy bone (trabeculae).
* Identify the main cell types in bone tissue and their functions.

**Module 3: Bone Development and Growth**

Ossification (Bone Formation):
* Describe the process of intramembranous ossification.
* Describe the process of endochondral ossification.
* Explain the role of the epiphyseal plate in long bone growth.

Bone Remodeling:
* Explain the process of bone remodeling and its importance.
* What roles do osteoblasts and osteoclasts play in bone remodeling?

**Module 4: Joints (Articulations) - Where Bones Meet**

Classification of Joints:
* Describe the structural classification of joints (fibrous, cartilaginous, synovial).
* Describe the functional classification of joints (synarthroses, amphiarthroses, diarthroses).

Fibrous Joints:
* Describe the types of fibrous joints (sutures, syndesmoses, gomphoses) and provide examples of each.

Cartilaginous Joints:
* Describe the types of cartilaginous joints (synchondroses, symphyses) and provide examples of each.

Synovial Joints:
* Describe the general structure of a synovial joint (articular cartilage, joint cavity, synovial fluid, articular capsule, reinforcing ligaments).
* List and describe the different types of synovial joints based on their shape and movement allowed (plane, hinge, pivot, condylar, saddle, ball-and-socket) and provide examples of each.

**Module 5: Movement and Levers**

Muscles and Bones Working Together:
* Explain the role of bones as levers for muscle action.
* Define the components of a lever system (fulcrum, effort, load).
* Describe the three classes of levers and provide examples in the human body.

Joint Movements:
* Describe common movements that occur at synovial joints (flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, rotation, etc.).

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Skeletal Disorders and Therapies**

Common Skeletal Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common skeletal disorders (e.g., fractures, osteoporosis, arthritis, scoliosis).

Joint Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common joint disorders (e.g., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, sprains, dislocations).

Pharmacological Therapies for Skeletal Conditions:
* Provide examples of drugs used to treat skeletal disorders (e.g., pain relievers, anti-inflammatory drugs, bisphosphonates).

Clinical Therapies for Joint Conditions:
* Provide examples of clinical therapies for joint disorders (e.g., physical therapy, joint replacement surgery).

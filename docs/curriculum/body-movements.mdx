# Types of Body Movements

**Module 1: Introduction to Body Movements**

Defining Body Movement:
* What constitutes body movement?
* What are the primary structures responsible for generating body movements?

Categorizing Body Movements:
* Introduce the broad categories of body movements that occur at synovial joints.

**Module 2: Gliding Movements**

Description:
* Describe gliding movements. What type of joint primarily allows these movements?

Examples:
* Provide specific examples of gliding movements in the body.

**Module 3: Angular Movements**

Description:
* Define angular movements. What changes during these movements?

Flexion:
* Define flexion and provide examples at different joints.

Extension:
* Define extension and provide examples at different joints.
* What is hyperextension? Provide examples.

Abduction:
* Define abduction and provide examples at different joints.

Adduction:
* Define adduction and provide examples at different joints.

Circumduction:
* Define circumduction and explain the sequence of movements involved. Provide examples.

**Module 4: Rotational Movements**

Description:
* Define rotational movements. Around what axis do these movements occur?

Medial (Internal) Rotation:
* Define medial rotation and provide examples at different joints.

Lateral (External) Rotation:
* Define lateral rotation and provide examples at different joints.

**Module 5: Special Movements**

Description:
* Introduce special movements as those that occur at specific joints and do not fit neatly into the gliding, angular, or rotational categories.

Dorsiflexion and Plantar Flexion:
* Define and provide examples of these movements at the ankle joint.

Inversion and Eversion:
* Define and provide examples of these movements at the subtalar joint.

Protraction and Retraction:
* Define and provide examples of these movements, particularly at the mandible and scapula.

Elevation and Depression:
* Define and provide examples of these movements, particularly at the mandible and scapula.

Opposition:
* Define opposition and describe where this unique movement occurs.

Supination and Pronation:
* Define and describe these movements of the forearm.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance: Movement Restrictions and Abnormalities**

Range of Motion (ROM):
* Explain the concept of range of motion and its clinical significance.

Movement Restrictions:
* Briefly discuss factors that can limit joint movement (e.g., injury, inflammation, arthritis).

Abnormal Movements:
* Briefly describe examples of abnormal or involuntary movements.

Therapeutic Interventions:
* Briefly mention therapeutic approaches (e.g., physical therapy, medications) used to address movement restrictions and abnormalities.

# Pregnancy: Physiological Changes and Fetal Development

**Module 1: Introduction to Pregnancy**

Defining Pregnancy:
* What is pregnancy (gestation)?
* How is the duration of pregnancy typically measured?
* What are the three trimesters of pregnancy?

Key Events of Early Pregnancy:
* Briefly review fertilization and implantation.
* What is the role of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)?

**Module 2: Maternal Physiological Changes During Pregnancy**

Cardiovascular System:
* Describe the changes in blood volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure during pregnancy.

Respiratory System:
* Describe the changes in respiratory rate, tidal volume, and oxygen consumption during pregnancy.

Urinary System:
* Describe the changes in kidney function and urinary frequency during pregnancy.

Digestive System:
* Describe common gastrointestinal changes during pregnancy (e.g., nausea, vomiting, constipation).

Endocrine System:
* Discuss the major hormonal changes during pregnancy (e.g., hCG, estrogen, progesterone, human placental lactogen).

Metabolic Changes:
* Describe the alterations in glucose metabolism and energy demands during pregnancy.

Weight Gain:
* Discuss the typical pattern and components of weight gain during pregnancy.

**Module 3: Fetal Development - First Trimester**

Embryonic Period:
* Briefly review the major events of the embryonic period (weeks 1-8), including organogenesis.
* What is the role of the placenta?

Early Fetal Development:
* Describe key developmental milestones during the first trimester.

**Module 4: Fetal Development - Second Trimester**

Growth and Maturation:
* Describe the continued growth and maturation of fetal organs and systems during the second trimester.
* When can fetal movement typically be felt?

**Module 5: Fetal Development - Third Trimester**

Rapid Growth and Preparation for Birth:
* Describe the rapid growth and weight gain of the fetus during the third trimester.
* Discuss fetal positioning in preparation for labor.

**Module 6: Labor and Parturition**

Stages of Labor:
* Describe the three stages of labor (dilation, expulsion, placental).
* What are the key events of each stage?

Hormonal Control of Labor:
* Discuss the roles of hormones (e.g., oxytocin, prostaglandins) in initiating and progressing labor.

**Module 7: Clinical Relevance - Pregnancy and Its Complications**

Common Discomforts of Pregnancy:
* Briefly mention common discomforts and their management.

Complications of Pregnancy:
* Briefly describe examples of potential complications (e.g., gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm labor).

Prenatal Care:
* Emphasize the importance of regular prenatal care.

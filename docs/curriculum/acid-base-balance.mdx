# Acid-Base Balance: Maintaining the Body's pH

**Module 1: Introduction to Acid-Base Balance**

Defining Acids and Bases:
* Define acids and bases in terms of hydrogen ion ($H^+$) concentration.
* What is pH and what is the normal pH range of arterial blood?
* Why is maintaining a narrow pH range crucial for physiological functions?

Sources of Acids in the Body:
* Describe the major sources of acids produced by the body (e.g., metabolic acids, carbon dioxide).

**Module 2: Buffering Systems of the Body**

Chemical Buffers:
* Define chemical buffer systems.
* Describe the bicarbonate buffer system: components, mechanism of action, and its importance in blood.
* Describe the phosphate buffer system: components and mechanism of action.
* Describe the protein buffer system: components (hemoglobin, plasma proteins) and mechanism of action.

Physiological Buffers:
* Introduce the respiratory system and the kidneys as physiological buffer systems.

**Module 3: Respiratory Regulation of Acid-Base Balance**

Role of Carbon Dioxide:
* Explain the relationship between carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and hydrogen ion concentration.
* How does hyperventilation affect blood pH? How does hypoventilation affect blood pH?

Respiratory Control Mechanisms:
* Describe how the respiratory centers in the brainstem respond to changes in blood $CO_2$ and pH.

**Module 4: Renal Regulation of Acid-Base Balance**

Kidney Role in pH Regulation:
* Explain the long-term regulation of acid-base balance by the kidneys.
* Describe the reabsorption of bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$) by the renal tubules.
* Explain the excretion of hydrogen ions ($H^+$) by the kidneys:
    * Buffering in urine (phosphate buffer system).
    * Excretion of ammonium ($NH_4^+$).
* Describe the generation of new bicarbonate by the kidneys.

**Module 5: Acid-Base Imbalances**

Acidosis:
* Define acidosis (metabolic and respiratory).
* Describe the causes and compensatory mechanisms for metabolic acidosis.
* Describe the causes and compensatory mechanisms for respiratory acidosis.

Alkalosis:
* Define alkalosis (metabolic and respiratory).
* Describe the causes and compensatory mechanisms for metabolic alkalosis.
* Describe the causes and compensatory mechanisms for respiratory alkalosis.

**Module 6: Clinical Assessment of Acid-Base Balance**

Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Analysis:
* Explain the components of an ABG report (pH, $PaCO_2$, $HCO_3^-$).
* Describe how ABG values are used to diagnose acid-base imbalances and determine their origin (metabolic vs. respiratory).

**Module 7: Clinical Management of Acid-Base Imbalances**

Treatment Strategies:
* Discuss general principles for treating acidosis and alkalosis.
* Provide examples of medical interventions for specific acid-base imbalances (e.g., bicarbonate administration, mechanical ventilation).

# Connective Tissue: Support, Connection, and More

**Module 1: Introduction to Connective Tissue**

Defining Connective Tissue:
* What is connective tissue? What are its primary roles in the body?
* What are the three main characteristics that distinguish connective tissue from other tissue types?

Basic Components of Connective Tissue:
* Describe the two main components of connective tissue:
    * Extracellular Matrix: What is it composed of?
    * Cells: What are the major cell types found in connective tissue?

**Module 2: Extracellular Matrix - The Ground Substance and Fibers**

Ground Substance:
* What is ground substance? Describe its composition, including interstitial fluid, proteoglycans, and cell adhesion proteins.
* What are the functions of ground substance?

Fibers:
* Describe the three main types of protein fibers found in the extracellular matrix:
    * Collagen Fibers: Structure, properties (strength), and locations.
    * Elastic Fibers: Structure, properties (elasticity), and locations.
    * Reticular Fibers: Structure, properties (supportive mesh), and locations.

**Module 3: Cells of Connective Tissue**

"Blast" Cells:
* What are "blast" cells? What is their general function?
* Describe the specific "blast" cells for the major connective tissue types:
    * Fibroblasts
    * Chondroblasts
    * Osteoblasts
    * Hematopoietic Stem Cells

"Cyte" Cells:
* What are "cyte" cells? What is their general function?
* Describe the specific "cyte" cells for the major connective tissue types:
    * Fibrocytes
    * Chondrocytes
    * Osteocytes

Other Connective Tissue Cells:
* Describe the functions of the following other cell types found in connective tissue:
    * Adipocytes (Fat Cells)
    * White Blood Cells (Leukocytes)
    * Mast Cells
    * Macrophages

**Module 4: Classification of Connective Tissue**

Connective Tissue Proper:
* Describe the characteristics and subtypes of loose connective tissue:
    * Areolar Connective Tissue: Structure, function, and location.
    * Adipose Tissue: Structure, function, and location.
    * Reticular Connective Tissue: Structure, function, and location.
* Describe the characteristics and subtypes of dense connective tissue:
    * Dense Regular Connective Tissue: Structure, function, and location.
    * Dense Irregular Connective Tissue: Structure, function, and location.
    * Elastic Connective Tissue: Structure, function, and location.

Cartilage:
* Describe the general characteristics of cartilage.
* Identify and describe the three types of cartilage, including their matrix composition, cells (chondrocytes in lacunae), function, and location:
    * Hyaline Cartilage
    * Elastic Cartilage
    * Fibrocartilage

Bone Tissue (Osseous Tissue):
* Describe the general characteristics of bone tissue.
* Identify the cells of bone tissue (osteocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts).
* Describe the structure of compact bone and spongy bone.
* What are the functions of bone tissue?

Blood:
* Describe the unique characteristics of blood as a connective tissue.
* Identify the cellular components of blood (erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets) and the extracellular matrix (plasma).
* What are the functions of blood?

**Module 5: Clinical Relevance - Connective Tissue Disorders and Functions**

Connective Tissue Support and Repair:
* Discuss the role of connective tissue in providing structural support, binding other tissues together, and facilitating tissue repair.
* Explain how damage to connective tissue (e.g., sprains, tears) affects function and the healing process.

Connective Tissue Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common connective tissue disorders, such as:
    * Arthritis (Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis)
    * Osteoporosis
    * Connective Tissue Diseases (e.g., Lupus, Scleroderma)
    * Genetic Disorders (e.g., Marfan Syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome)

Pharmacological Targeting of Connective Tissue:
* Provide examples of how drugs are used to treat connective tissue disorders (e.g., anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants).
* Briefly mention therapies aimed at promoting connective tissue repair.

# The Lymphatic System: Immunity and Fluid Balance

**Module 1: Introduction to the Lymphatic System**

Defining the Lymphatic System:
* What are the main components of the lymphatic system?
* What are the two primary functions of the lymphatic system?

Relationship to the Cardiovascular System:
* Explain how the lymphatic system interacts with the cardiovascular system.

**Module 2: Lymphatic Vessels - The Drainage Network**

Structure of Lymphatic Vessels:
* Describe the structure of lymphatic capillaries and how they differ from blood capillaries.
* Explain the role of minivalves in lymphatic capillaries.
* Describe the structure of collecting lymphatic vessels and lymphatic trunks.

Lymph Flow:
* Explain the mechanisms that drive lymph flow.
* What is lymph? Where does it originate?

**Module 3: Lymphoid Tissues and Organs - Sites of Immune Function**

Lymph Nodes:
* Describe the structure of a lymph node (cortex, medulla, sinuses).
* Explain the functions of lymph nodes in filtering lymph and immune surveillance.

Spleen:
* Describe the structure of the spleen (red pulp, white pulp).
* Explain the functions of the spleen in filtering blood and immune responses.

Thymus:
* Describe the structure and primary function of the thymus in T cell maturation.

Tonsils:
* Describe the location and function of the tonsils (palatine, lingual, pharyngeal).

Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT):
* Describe MALT and its locations in the body.
* Explain the function of MALT in immune defense at mucosal surfaces.

**Module 4: Lymph and Immunity**

Lymph Composition:
* What does lymph contain?

Immune Cell Transport:
* Explain how the lymphatic system facilitates the transport of immune cells (lymphocytes, macrophages).

Lymphatic Drainage and Immune Surveillance:
* Describe how lymph nodes monitor lymph for pathogens and antigens.

**Module 5: Lymphatic System and Fluid Balance**

Interstitial Fluid Drainage:
* Explain the role of lymphatic vessels in collecting excess interstitial fluid and returning it to the bloodstream.

Prevention of Edema:
* How does the lymphatic system help prevent edema?

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Disorders of the Lymphatic System**

Lymphedema:
* Define lymphedema and describe its common causes.

Lymphadenopathy:
* What is lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) and what does it typically indicate?

Lymphoma:
* Briefly describe lymphoma as a cancer of lymphatic tissue.

Metastasis and the Lymphatic System:
* Explain how the lymphatic system can be a route for cancer metastasis.

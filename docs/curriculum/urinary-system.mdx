# The Urinary System: Maintaining Fluid, Electrolyte, and Waste Balance

**Module 1: Introduction to the Urinary System**

Defining the Urinary System:
* What are the primary functions of the urinary system?
* List the major organs of the urinary system.

Overview of Homeostatic Roles:
* Explain the role of the urinary system in regulating blood volume, blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and acid-base balance.
* Describe its function in waste removal.

**Module 2: Anatomy of the Kidneys**

External Anatomy:
* Describe the location and gross anatomy of the kidneys.
* Identify the major external features (renal capsule, hilum).

Internal Anatomy:
* Describe the major internal structures of the kidney (renal cortex, renal medulla, renal pyramids, renal columns, renal pelvis, calyces).

Blood Supply to the Kidneys:
* Trace the flow of blood through the kidney, including the renal artery, afferent arterioles, glomerulus, efferent arterioles, peritubular capillaries/vasa recta, and renal vein.

**Module 3: The Nephron - The Functional Unit of the Kidney**

Structure of the Nephron:
* Describe the two main parts of a nephron (renal corpuscle and renal tubule).
* Detail the components of the renal corpuscle (glomerulus and Bowman's capsule).
* Detail the components of the renal tubule (proximal convoluted tubule - PCT, nephron loop/loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule - DCT).
* What is the collecting duct?

Types of Nephrons:
* Differentiate between cortical and juxtamedullary nephrons.

**Module 4: Urine Formation - Filtration, Reabsorption, and Secretion**

Glomerular Filtration:
* Explain the process of glomerular filtration and the forces involved (glomerular hydrostatic pressure, capsular hydrostatic pressure, blood colloid osmotic pressure).
* What is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and how is it regulated?

Tubular Reabsorption:
* Explain the process of tubular reabsorption.
* Describe the reabsorption of water, glucose, amino acids, ions, and urea in different parts of the renal tubule (PCT, loop of Henle, DCT, collecting duct).

Tubular Secretion:
* Explain the process of tubular secretion.
* Describe the secretion of hydrogen ions, potassium ions, creatinine, and certain drugs in different parts of the renal tubule (PCT, DCT, collecting duct).

**Module 5: Urine Composition and Characteristics**

Normal Urine:
* Describe the typical composition and physical characteristics of normal urine.

Abnormal Urine Components:
* Briefly mention examples of abnormal substances found in urine and their clinical significance (e.g., glucose, proteins, ketones, blood).

**Module 6: Regulation of Urine Concentration and Volume**

Countercurrent Mechanism:
* Explain the countercurrent multiplier and countercurrent exchanger in the loop of Henle and vasa recta and their role in concentrating urine.

Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH):
* Describe the role of ADH in regulating water reabsorption in the collecting duct.

Aldosterone:
* Describe the role of aldosterone in regulating sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion in the DCT and collecting duct.

Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP):
* Describe the role of ANP in increasing water and sodium excretion.

**Module 7: Clinical Relevance - Urinary System Disorders and Pharmacology**

Common Urinary Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common urinary disorders (e.g., urinary tract infections - UTIs, kidney stones, renal failure, incontinence).

Renal Function Tests:
* Briefly mention common tests used to assess kidney function (e.g., GFR, blood urea nitrogen - BUN, creatinine).

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Provide examples of drugs that affect the urinary system (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, drugs for overactive bladder).

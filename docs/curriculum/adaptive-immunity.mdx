# Adaptive Immunity: Specific and Memory-Based Defense

**Module 1: Introduction to Adaptive Immunity**

Defining Adaptive Immunity:
* What is adaptive immunity?
* What are its key characteristics that distinguish it from innate immunity (specificity, systemic response, memory)?
* What are the two main branches of adaptive immunity?

Antigens:
* Define antigens and explain their role in triggering adaptive immune responses.
* What are epitopes?

**Module 2: Humoral Immunity - B Cells and Antibodies**

B Lymphocytes (B Cells):
* Describe the origin and maturation of B cells.
* What are B cell receptors (BCRs)? How do they recognize antigens?

B Cell Activation:
* Explain the process of B cell activation by antigens and helper T cells (T helper 2 cells).

Differentiation of B Cells:
* Describe the differentiation of activated B cells into plasma cells and memory B cells.

Antibodies (Immunoglobulins):
* Describe the structure of an antibody molecule.
* List and describe the functions of the five classes of antibodies (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE).

Antibody Actions:
* Explain the mechanisms by which antibodies eliminate antigens (neutralization, agglutination, precipitation, complement fixation, opsonization).

Immunological Memory:
* Describe the primary and secondary (anamnestic) immune responses and the role of memory B cells.

**Module 3: Cellular Immunity - T Cells and Cell-Mediated Killing**

T Lymphocytes (T Cells):
* Describe the origin and maturation of T cells (thymus).
* What are T cell receptors (TCRs)? How do they recognize antigens?
* Explain the role of MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules in antigen presentation.

T Cell Activation:
* Describe the activation of helper T cells (CD4+) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

Helper T Cells (CD4+):
* Explain the role of helper T cells (T helper 1 and T helper 2) in activating other immune cells through cytokine secretion.

Cytotoxic T Cells (CD8+):
* Explain how cytotoxic T cells recognize and kill infected or cancerous cells.

Memory T Cells:
* Describe the role of memory T cells in the secondary immune response.

**Module 4: Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs)**

Types of APCs:
* Describe the main types of antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells) and their locations.

Antigen Processing and Presentation:
* Explain the process by which APCs engulf and process antigens.
* Describe how antigens are presented on MHC class I and MHC class II molecules.
* Explain which T cell subsets recognize antigens presented on each type of MHC molecule.

**Module 5: Immunological Tolerance and Autoimmunity**

Immunological Tolerance:
* What is immunological tolerance?
* Explain the mechanisms that prevent the immune system from attacking self-antigens (clonal deletion, anergy, regulatory T cells).

Autoimmunity:
* What is autoimmunity?
* Briefly describe examples of autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis).
* What are some potential causes of autoimmunity?

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Adaptive Immune Dysfunction and Manipulation**

Immunodeficiency Disorders:
* Describe examples of primary and secondary immunodeficiency disorders (e.g., SCID, HIV/AIDS).

Hypersensitivity Reactions (Allergies):
* Describe the mechanisms of Type I, II, III, and IV hypersensitivity reactions.

Transplantation and Rejection:
* Explain the role of MHC in graft rejection and the use of immunosuppressants.

Vaccination:
* Explain the principles of vaccination in inducing adaptive immunity and immunological memory.

Monoclonal Antibodies:
* Briefly mention the therapeutic use of monoclonal antibodies.

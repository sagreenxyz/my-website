# The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)

57. What is the primary role of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)? Is it voluntary or involuntary?
    -   **Role:** Regulates involuntary physiological processes including heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, digestion, and sexual arousal.
    -   **Control:** Involuntary.

58. What are the two main branches of the ANS? What is the general function/state associated with each (e.g., "fight-or-flight" vs. "rest-and-digest")?
    -   **Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS):** Associated with the "fight-or-flight" response; mobilizes the body during stress or activity.
    -   **Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS):** Associated with the "rest-and-digest" state; conserves energy and promotes housekeeping functions during rest.

59. How does the two-neuron pathway (preganglionic and postganglionic neurons) differ anatomically between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions? (Focus on neuron length and ganglion location).
    -   **Sympathetic:**
        -   Preganglionic neurons: Short, originate in the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord.
        -   Postganglionic neurons: Long.
        -   Ganglia: Located close to the spinal cord (sympathetic chain ganglia or collateral ganglia).
    -   **Parasympathetic:**
        -   Preganglionic neurons: Long, originate in the brainstem (craniosacral outflow) or sacral region of the spinal cord.
        -   Postganglionic neurons: Short.
        -   Ganglia: Located in or near the target effector organs (terminal ganglia).

60. What are the primary neurotransmitters released by preganglionic and postganglionic neurons in the sympathetic division?
    -   **Preganglionic:** Acetylcholine (ACh) - acts on nicotinic receptors.
    -   **Postganglionic:** Norepinephrine (NE) - acts on adrenergic receptors (alpha or beta) on most target organs. (Exception: ACh for sweat glands).

61. What are the primary neurotransmitters released by preganglionic and postganglionic neurons in the parasympathetic division?
    -   **Preganglionic:** Acetylcholine (ACh) - acts on nicotinic receptors.
    -   **Postganglionic:** Acetylcholine (ACh) - acts on muscarinic receptors on target organs.

62. What is dual innervation, and why is it important for regulating target organs?
    -   **Definition:** Most visceral organs receive nerve fibers from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.
    -   **Importance:** Allows for precise control over organ activity. The two divisions often have antagonistic (opposite) effects, enabling fine-tuning of physiological responses (e.g., speeding up vs. slowing down heart rate).

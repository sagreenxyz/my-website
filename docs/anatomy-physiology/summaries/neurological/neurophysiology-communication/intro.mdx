# Neurophysiology: How Neurons Work and Communicate

15. What is membrane potential? Why do cells, especially neurons, have it? (Hint: Ion distribution, electrochemical gradients)
    -   **Definition:** A voltage difference across the plasma membrane.
    -   **Reason:** Caused by an unequal distribution of ions (charged particles) between the inside and outside of the cell, creating both a chemical gradient (concentration difference) and an electrical gradient. This potential energy is used for signaling (especially in neurons and muscle cells) and driving transport processes.

16. What is the resting membrane potential of a neuron? How is it established and maintained? (Hint: Na+/K+ pump, leak channels)
    -   **Definition:** The stable membrane potential of a neuron when it is not actively signaling (typically around -70mV, meaning the inside is negative relative to the outside).
    -   **Establishment & Maintenance:**
        -   **Differential Permeability:** The membrane is much more permeable to K+ ions than to Na+ ions at rest due to more K+ **leak channels**. K+ tends to diffuse out down its concentration gradient, making the inside negative.
        -   **Na+/K+ Pump:** Actively transports 3 Na+ ions *out* of the cell for every 2 K+ ions *into* the cell, using ATP. This maintains the concentration gradients for Na+ and K+ across the membrane, counteracting the leak currents and preserving the resting potential.

17. What are graded potentials? Where do they occur on a neuron, and what are their characteristics?
    -   **Definition:** Short-lived, localized changes in membrane potential that can be either depolarizations (less negative) or hyperpolarizations (more negative).
    -   **Location:** Typically occur on dendrites and the cell body (soma) in response to stimuli (e.g., neurotransmitter binding).
    -   **Characteristics:**
        -   **Graded:** Magnitude varies directly with stimulus strength (stronger stimulus = larger potential change).
        -   **Decremental:** Signal decays with distance from the origin (they don't travel far).
        -   **Summation:** Can add together (summate) to influence action potential generation.

18. What is an action potential? Where does it occur on a neuron, and how does it differ fundamentally from a graded potential?
    -   **Definition:** A brief, large reversal of membrane potential (from negative to positive and back) that propagates along an axon; a nerve impulse.
    -   **Location:** Generated at the axon hillock (trigger zone) and propagates down the axon.
    -   **Fundamental Differences from Graded Potentials:**
        -   **All-or-None:** Not graded; occurs maximally or not at all if threshold is reached.
        -   **Non-decremental:** Propagates without loss of strength over long distances.
        -   **Requires Threshold:** Only occurs if the membrane potential reaches a specific threshold level.
        -   **Involves Voltage-Gated Channels:** Mediated by voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels, unlike the ligand-gated or mechanically-gated channels often involved in graded potentials.

19. What is the threshold potential? What happens when it is reached?
    -   **Definition:** The critical level of membrane depolarization (typically around -55mV) that must be reached at the axon hillock to trigger an action potential.
    -   **Consequence:** Reaching threshold causes voltage-gated Na+ channels to open rapidly, leading to a large influx of Na+ and the rapid depolarization phase of the action potential.

20. What are the phases of an action potential (depolarization, repolarization, hyperpolarization), and what specific ion channel events cause each phase? (Hint: Voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels)
    -   **1. Resting State:** All voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels are closed. Resting membrane potential maintained.
    -   **2. Depolarization:** A stimulus causes graded potentials that reach threshold. Voltage-gated Na+ channels open quickly, Na+ rushes *in*, making the inside rapidly positive (+30mV).
    -   **3. Repolarization:** Voltage-gated Na+ channels inactivate. Voltage-gated K+ channels open slowly, K+ rushes *out*, restoring the negative membrane potential.
    -   **4. Hyperpolarization (Undershoot):** Voltage-gated K+ channels remain open briefly after repolarization, allowing excess K+ efflux, making the membrane potential slightly more negative than resting potential before returning to rest as K+ channels close.

21. What does the "all-or-none" principle mean regarding action potentials?
    -   An action potential either happens completely (if threshold is reached) with a consistent amplitude and duration, or it doesn't happen at all (if threshold is not reached). There are no "partial" or "graded" action potentials. The strength of the initial stimulus is encoded by the *frequency* of action potentials, not their size.

22. How does an action potential propagate along an unmyelinated axon?
    -   **Continuous Conduction:** The influx of Na+ during depolarization at one point creates local currents that depolarize the adjacent membrane segment to threshold. This triggers voltage-gated Na+ channels to open in that next segment, regenerating the action potential. This process repeats sequentially along the entire length of the axon membrane like a wave. It is relatively slow.

23. How does an action potential propagate along a myelinated axon? What is saltatory conduction, and why is it advantageous?
    -   **Saltatory Conduction:** Myelin acts as an insulator, preventing ion leakage across the membrane except at the gaps called **Nodes of Ranvier**, where voltage-gated channels are concentrated. The action potential is generated only at these nodes. The electrical current flows rapidly *underneath* the myelin sheath from one node to the next, depolarizing it to threshold. The action potential appears to "jump" from node to node.
    -   **Advantages:** Saltatory conduction is much **faster** and more **energy-efficient** (less ion pumping needed) than continuous conduction.

24. What is a synapse? What are the two main types of synapses (electrical and chemical)?
    -   **Definition:** A junction where information is transmitted from one neuron (presynaptic neuron) to another cell (postsynaptic neuron or effector cell like muscle/gland).
    -   **Types:**
        -   **Electrical Synapses:** Cells are directly connected by gap junctions, allowing ions to flow directly between them. Transmission is very fast and bidirectional. Less common in the nervous system.
        -   **Chemical Synapses:** Cells are separated by a synaptic cleft. Transmission involves the release of chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) from the presynaptic neuron that bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. Slower but allow for more complex signal processing (modulation, inhibition). Most common type.

25. How does signal transmission occur across a chemical synapse? (Focus on: presynaptic terminal, neurotransmitters, synaptic vesicles, synaptic cleft, postsynaptic receptors)
    1.  Action potential arrives at the **presynaptic axon terminal**.
    2.  Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open, Ca2+ enters the terminal.
    3.  Ca2+ influx triggers the fusion of **synaptic vesicles** (containing **neurotransmitters**) with the presynaptic membrane.
    4.  Neurotransmitters are released into the **synaptic cleft** via exocytosis.
    5.  Neurotransmitters diffuse across the cleft and bind to specific **postsynaptic receptors** on the postsynaptic membrane.
    6.  Binding opens or closes ion channels, causing a graded potential (EPSP or IPSP) in the postsynaptic neuron.

26. What determines whether a neurotransmitter causes excitation (EPSP - Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential) or inhibition (IPSP - Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential) on the postsynaptic neuron?
    -   It depends on the **type of receptor** the neurotransmitter binds to on the postsynaptic membrane and the **type of ion channel** that receptor controls.
    -   **EPSP:** Binding leads to the opening of channels permeable to both Na+ and K+ (but Na+ influx dominates), causing **depolarization** (making the neuron *more* likely to fire an action potential).
    -   **IPSP:** Binding leads to the opening of channels permeable to K+ (K+ efflux) or Cl- (Cl- influx), causing **hyperpolarization** or stabilization of the resting potential (making the neuron *less* likely to fire an action potential).

27. How are neurotransmitter signals terminated in the synaptic cleft? (Hint: Degradation, reuptake, diffusion)
    -   **Enzymatic Degradation:** Enzymes in the synaptic cleft break down the neurotransmitter (e.g., acetylcholinesterase breaks down ACh).
    -   **Reuptake:** Neurotransmitters are actively transported back into the presynaptic terminal or absorbed by glial cells (astrocytes).
    -   **Diffusion:** Neurotransmitters simply drift away from the synaptic cleft.
    -   (Termination is crucial to allow for precise timing of signals and prevent continuous stimulation/inhibition).

28. What is synaptic integration (summation)? How do temporal and spatial summation allow neurons to process multiple inputs?
    -   **Definition:** The process by which a postsynaptic neuron combines all the excitatory (EPSPs) and inhibitory (IPSPs) inputs it receives to determine whether it will fire an action potential.
    -   **Temporal Summation:** Multiple graded potentials occurring in rapid succession at the *same synapse* add together. If they collectively depolarize the axon hillock to threshold, an action potential is fired.
    -   **Spatial Summation:** Graded potentials occurring simultaneously at *different synapses* on the same neuron add together. If the net effect of all EPSPs and IPSPs depolarizes the axon hillock to threshold, an action potential is fired.

29. What are some major categories of neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine, biogenic amines, amino acids, peptides), and can you name one key function for each?
    -   **Acetylcholine (ACh):** Neuromuscular junction activation; autonomic nervous system function; CNS roles in learning/memory.
    -   **Biogenic Amines:**
        -   *Dopamine:* Motor control, reward pathways, motivation.
        -   *Norepinephrine (NE):* Alertness, arousal, sympathetic responses ("fight-or-flight").
        -   *Serotonin (5-HT):* Mood regulation, sleep, appetite.
    -   **Amino Acids:**
        -   *Glutamate:* Major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS; learning and memory.
        -   *GABA (Gamma-aminobutyric acid):* Major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.
        -   *Glycine:* Major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord.
    -   **Peptides (Neuropeptides):**
        -   *Endorphins/Enkephalins:* Natural opiates, reduce pain perception.
        -   *Substance P:* Transmits pain signals.

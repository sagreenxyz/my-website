# Neurological

Here is a curriculum for understanding the nervous system, presented as sequential questions. Following this path should build a comprehensive understanding from the ground up, covering both anatomy (structure) and physiology (function).

This curriculum progresses from the general overview and cellular basics to complex structures and integrated functions.

25. How does signal transmission occur across a chemical synapse? (Focus on: presynaptic terminal, neurotransmitters, synaptic vesicles, synaptic cleft, postsynaptic receptors)
26. What determines whether a neurotransmitter causes excitation (EPSP - Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential) or inhibition (IPSP - Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential) on the postsynaptic neuron?
27. How are neurotransmitter signals terminated in the synaptic cleft? (Hint: Degradation, reuptake, diffusion)
28. What is synaptic integration (summation)? How do temporal and spatial summation allow neurons to process multiple inputs?
29. What are some major categories of neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine, biogenic amines, amino acids, peptides), and can you name one key function for each?

**IV. The Central Nervous System (CNS): Brain and Spinal Cord**

This sequence provides a framework. Depending on the desired depth, each question can lead to further sub-questions and more detailed exploration. Good luck with developing the curricula!

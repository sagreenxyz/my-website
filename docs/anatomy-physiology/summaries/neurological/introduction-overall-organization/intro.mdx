# Introduction and Overall Organization

1.  Why do we need a nervous system? What are its fundamental roles in the body?
    -   **Need:** To coordinate the body's activities, respond to internal and external changes, and maintain homeostasis. It's the primary control and communication system.
    -   **Fundamental Roles:**
        -   **Sensory Input:** Gathering information (stimuli) from sensory receptors inside and outside the body.
        -   **Integration:** Processing and interpreting sensory input and deciding what should be done.
        -   **Motor Output:** Activating effector organs (muscles and glands) to cause a response.

2.  What are the two major anatomical divisions of the nervous system? (Hint: Central vs. Peripheral)
    -   **Central Nervous System (CNS):** Consists of the brain and spinal cord.
    -   **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):** Consists of nerves (spinal and cranial) and ganglia outside the CNS.

3.  What are the main functional divisions of the nervous system? (Hint: Sensory input, integration, motor output)
    -   **Sensory (Afferent) Division:** Carries sensory information from receptors *to* the CNS.
    -   **Integration:** Processing and interpretation occurring primarily within the CNS.
    -   **Motor (Efferent) Division:** Carries motor commands *from* the CNS *to* effectors (muscles and glands).

4.  What components make up the Central Nervous System (CNS)?
    -   Brainn (inside cranium, cranial cavity)
    -   Spinal Cord (inside verteba, vertebral column)

5.  What components make up the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)?
    -   Cranial Nerves (and their ganglia)
    -   Spinal Nerves (and their ganglia)
    -   Sensory Receptors```

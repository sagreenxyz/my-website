# Cellular Foundations: The Neuron and Glia

6.  What are the two primary types of cells in nervous tissue?
    -   Neurons
    -   Glial cells (Neuroglia)

7.  What is a neuron? What is its primary function?
    -   **Definition:** A specialized cell that is the basic functional unit of the nervous system.
    -   **Function:** To transmit electrical and chemical signals (nerve impulses or action potentials) throughout the body, enabling communication between different parts of the nervous system and with other body systems (like muscles and glands).

8.  What are the main structural parts of a typical neuron (e.g., dendrites, soma, axon, axon terminal), and what does each part do?
    -   **Dendrites:** Branch-like extensions that receive signals from other neurons and transmit them towards the cell body.
    -   **Soma (Cell Body):** Contains the nucleus and organelles; integrates incoming signals and generates outgoing signals if threshold is reached.
    -   **Axon:** A long projection that carries nerve impulses (action potentials) away from the soma towards other neurons, muscles, or glands.
    -   **Axon Terminal (Synaptic Terminal):** The branched ending of the axon that transmits signals to other cells at junctions called synapses, typically by releasing neurotransmitters.

9.  How are neurons classified based on structure (e.g., multipolar, bipolar, unipolar)?
    -   **Multipolar:** One axon and multiple dendrites (most common type, e.g., motor neurons, interneurons).
    -   **Bipolar:** One axon and one dendrite extending from opposite ends of the soma (rare, found in special sensory organs like the retina, olfactory epithelium).
    -   **Unipolar (Pseudounipolar):** A single short process extending from the soma that splits into a peripheral process (acting like a dendrite) and a central process (acting like an axon) (primarily sensory neurons in the PNS).

10. How are neurons classified based on function (e.g., sensory, motor, interneuron)?
    -   **Sensory (Afferent) Neurons:** Transmit impulses from sensory receptors towards the CNS.
    -   **Motor (Efferent) Neurons:** Transmit impulses from the CNS towards effectors (muscles or glands).
    -   **Interneurons (Association Neurons):** Located entirely within the CNS; connect sensory and motor neurons or other interneurons, involved in processing information.

11. What are glial cells (neuroglia)? Why are they essential if they aren't the primary signaling cells?
    -   **Definition:** Non-neuronal cells in the nervous system that support, nourish, and protect neurons.
    -   **Essential Role:** They provide structural support, insulate neurons (myelination), supply nutrients, remove waste products, participate in immune defense (microglia), regulate the chemical environment, and guide neuronal development and repair. They are crucial for the proper functioning and survival of neurons.

12. What are the different types of glial cells in the CNS (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, ependymal cells) and what is the main function of each?
    -   **Astrocytes:** Star-shaped; provide structural support, regulate the chemical environment (ions, neurotransmitters), contribute to the blood-brain barrier, aid in nutrient supply.
    -   **Oligodendrocytes:** Form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS, insulating them and speeding up signal transmission. One oligodendrocyte can myelinate multiple axons.
    -   **Microglia:** Phagocytic immune cells of the CNS; remove debris, pathogens, and damaged cells.
    -   **Ependymal Cells:** Line the ventricles of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord; produce and circulate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

13. What are the different types of glial cells in the PNS (Schwann cells, satellite cells) and what is the main function of each?
    -   **Schwann Cells (Neurolemmocytes):** Form myelin sheaths around axons in the PNS (similar function to oligodendrocytes in CNS, but one Schwann cell myelinates only one segment of one axon); also aid in regeneration of damaged peripheral nerve fibers.
    -   **Satellite Cells:** Surround neuron cell bodies within ganglia in the PNS; provide structural support and regulate the chemical environment around the neurons (similar function to astrocytes in CNS).

14. What is myelin? Which glial cells produce it in the CNS and PNS, and what is its crucial function for nerve impulses?
    -   **Definition:** A fatty, insulating sheath that surrounds the axons of many neurons.
    -   **Production:**
        -   CNS: Oligodendrocytes
        -   PNS: Schwann Cells
    -   **Function:** Insulates the axon, preventing leakage of electrical current and dramatically increasing the speed of nerve impulse conduction (via saltatory conduction, where the impulse "jumps" between the gaps in the myelin sheath called Nodes of Ranvier).

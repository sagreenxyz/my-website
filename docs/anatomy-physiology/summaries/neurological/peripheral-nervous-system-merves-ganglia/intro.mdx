# The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): Nerves and Ganglia

47. What are the structural components of the PNS (nerves, ganglia, sensory receptors)?
    -   **Sensory Receptors:** Structures that detect stimuli (changes in the internal or external environment).
    -   **Nerves:** Bundles of axons in the PNS that transmit sensory and motor information between the CNS and the rest of the body. Includes cranial nerves and spinal nerves.
    -   **Ganglia:** Collections of neuron cell bodies located outside the CNS.

48. How is a peripheral nerve structured? (Hint: Connective tissue wrappings - endoneurium, perineurium, epineurium)
    -   **Endoneurium:** Delicate connective tissue layer surrounding each individual axon (and its myelin sheath, if present).
    -   **Perineurium:** Coarser connective tissue wrapping that bundles groups of axons into fascicles.
    -   **Epineurium:** Tough fibrous sheath enclosing all the fascicles to form the nerve. (Blood vessels and lymphatic vessels are also found within these layers).

49. What is the difference between sensory (afferent) and motor (efferent) divisions of the PNS?
    -   **Sensory (Afferent) Division:** Consists of nerve fibers (axons) that convey impulses *from* sensory receptors throughout the body *to* the CNS.
    -   **Motor (Efferent) Division:** Consists of nerve fibers that transmit impulses *from* the CNS *to* effector organs (muscles and glands). This division is further subdivided into the Somatic Nervous System (voluntary control of skeletal muscle) and the Autonomic Nervous System (involuntary control of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands).

50. What are sensory receptors? How are they classified based on stimulus type (mechanoreceptor, thermoreceptor, photoreceptor, chemoreceptor, nociceptor)?
    -   **Definition:** Specialized structures that respond to specific stimuli by generating signals (graded potentials) that can trigger nerve impulses.
    -   **Classification by Stimulus Type:**
        -   **Mechanoreceptors:** Respond to mechanical force such as touch, pressure (including blood pressure), vibration, and stretch.
        -   **Thermoreceptors:** Respond to changes in temperature (hot or cold).
        -   **Photoreceptors:** Respond to light energy (e.g., retina of the eye).
        -   **Chemoreceptors:** Respond to chemicals in solution (e.g., molecules smelled or tasted, changes in blood chemistry).
        -   **Nociceptors:** Respond to potentially damaging stimuli that result in pain (e.g., extreme heat or cold, excessive pressure, inflammatory chemicals).

51. What are cranial nerves? How many pairs are there, and do they serve the head/neck primarily or also other body regions? (General understanding, not memorizing all XII initially).
    -   **Definition:** Nerves that originate from or terminate in the brain (primarily the brainstem).
    -   **Number:** There are **12 pairs** of cranial nerves (I-XII).
    -   **Service Area:** Most cranial nerves serve structures in the head and neck region (e.g., sensory input from eyes, ears, nose, tongue; motor control of facial muscles, eye muscles, tongue). However, one major cranial nerve, the Vagus nerve (X), extends beyond the head/neck to innervate visceral organs in the thorax and abdomen.

52. What are spinal nerves? How many pairs are there? How are they named?
    -   **Definition:** Nerves that arise from the spinal cord and exit the vertebral column through intervertebral foramina.
    -   **Number:** There are **31 pairs** of spinal nerves.
    -   **Naming:** They are named according to the region of the vertebral column from which they emerge:
        -   8 pairs of Cervical nerves (C1–C8)
        -   12 pairs of Thoracic nerves (T1–T12)
        -   5 pairs of Lumbar nerves (L1–L5)
        -   5 pairs of Sacral nerves (S1–S5)
        -   1 pair of Coccygeal nerves (Co1)

53. How are spinal nerves formed (dorsal and ventral roots)? What type of information does each root carry?
    -   **Formation:** Each spinal nerve connects to the spinal cord via two roots:
        -   **Dorsal Root:** Contains axons of **sensory (afferent)** neurons. Their cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglion associated with this root. Conducts impulses *from* peripheral receptors *to* the spinal cord.
        -   **Ventral Root:** Contains axons of **motor (efferent)** neurons originating in the ventral horn of the spinal cord grey matter. Conducts impulses *from* the spinal cord *to* effectors.
    -   The dorsal and ventral roots unite just distal to the dorsal root ganglion to form the spinal nerve itself. Therefore, spinal nerves are **mixed nerves**, containing both sensory and motor fibers.

54. What are nerve plexuses? Why are they important? (Name the major ones: cervical, brachial, lumbar, sacral).
    -   **Definition:** Complicated interlacing networks formed by the ventral rami (branches) of most spinal nerves (except T2-T12).
    -   **Importance:** Within a plexus, fibers from different spinal nerves crisscross and become redistributed. This means that each resulting branch of the plexus contains fibers from several spinal nerves. Advantage: Damage to a single spinal nerve root does not completely paralyze any limb muscle, as it receives input from multiple levels.
    -   **Major Plexuses:**
        -   **Cervical Plexus:** (C1-C4/C5) Innervates skin and muscles of the neck, ear, back of head, shoulders; includes phrenic nerve to diaphragm.
        -   **Brachial Plexus:** (C5-T1) Innervates the upper limb (arm, forearm, hand).
        -   **Lumbar Plexus:** (L1-L4) Innervates parts of the abdominal wall, psoas muscle, and anterior/medial thigh.
        -   **Sacral Plexus:** (L4-S4) Innervates the buttock, posterior thigh, leg, and foot; includes the sciatic nerve.

55. What is a reflex arc? What are its five basic components? (Receptor, sensory neuron, integration center, motor neuron, effector).
    -   **Definition:** The neural pathway that mediates a reflex action.
    -   **Five Basic Components:**
        1.  **Receptor:** Site of the stimulus action.
        2.  **Sensory Neuron:** Transmits the afferent impulse from the receptor to the CNS.
        3.  **Integration Center:** One or more synapses within the CNS (spinal cord or brainstem) where the sensory neuron connects with the motor neuron (monosynaptic reflex) or with interneurons that connect to motor neurons (polysynaptic reflex).
        4.  **Motor Neuron:** Transmits the efferent impulse from the integration center to the effector organ.
        5.  **Effector:** Muscle fiber or gland cell that responds to the efferent impulse (by contracting or secreting).

56. Distinguish between somatic and autonomic reflexes.
    -   **Somatic Reflexes:** Reflexes that activate **skeletal muscle**. The integration center is typically in the spinal cord or brainstem, and the motor pathway involves a single motor neuron from the CNS to the effector. Example: Patellar (knee-jerk) reflex, withdrawal reflex.
    -   **Autonomic (Visceral) Reflexes:** Reflexes that regulate the activity of **smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, or glands**. The integration center is often in the brainstem or spinal cord, but the motor pathway involves a two-neuron chain (preganglionic and postganglionic neuron) connecting the CNS to the effector. Example: Regulation of blood pressure, pupillary light reflex, digestive reflexes.

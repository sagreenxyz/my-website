# The Central Nervous System (CNS): Brain and Spinal Cord

30. How is the delicate CNS protected? (Hint: Bone, meninges, cerebrospinal fluid, blood-brain barrier)
    -   **Bone:** Skull protects the brain; Vertebral column protects the spinal cord.
    -   **Meninges:** Three connective tissue membranes surrounding the CNS.
    -   **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):** Fluid cushion within and around the CNS.
    -   **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB):** Selective barrier regulating passage of substances from blood to brain tissue.

31. What are the meninges? Name the three layers and their arrangement.
    -   **Definition:** Three protective connective tissue membranes that lie just external to the CNS organs.
    -   **Layers (from external to internal):**
        1.  **Dura Mater:** Tough, outermost layer.
        2.  **Arachnoid Mater:** Middle, web-like layer. (Subarachnoid space below contains CSF).
        3.  **Pia Mater:** Delicate, innermost layer clinging tightly to the brain and spinal cord surface.

32. What is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)? Where is it produced, where does it circulate, and what are its functions?
    -   **Definition:** Clear, watery fluid similar in composition to blood plasma (but with less protein and different ion concentrations).
    -   **Production:** Produced primarily by choroid plexuses located within the brain ventricles.
    -   **Circulation:** Circulates through the ventricles, into the subarachnoid space around the brain and spinal cord, and is eventually absorbed back into the blood via arachnoid granulations.
    -   **Functions:**
        -   **Buoyancy:** Reduces brain weight, preventing it from crushing under its own weight.
        -   **Protection:** Cushions the CNS from blows and trauma.
        -   **Chemical Stability:** Nourishes the brain and transports chemical signals; removes metabolic wastes.

33. What is the blood-brain barrier? What creates it, and why is it important?
    -   **Definition:** A selective barrier that separates circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid in the CNS.
    -   **Creation:** Formed by:
        -   Tight junctions between the endothelial cells lining brain capillaries.
        -   Thick basal lamina surrounding the capillaries.
        -   "Feet" of astrocytes clinging to the capillaries.
    -   **Importance:** Protects the brain from harmful substances (toxins, pathogens) in the blood while allowing essential nutrients (glucose, amino acids, electrolytes) and oxygen to pass through. Maintains a stable chemical environment crucial for precise neuronal function.

34. What is the basic structure of the spinal cord (grey matter vs. white matter, dorsal/ventral horns, spinal nerves)?
    -   **Cross-Section:** Butterfly or H-shaped core of **grey matter** (neuron cell bodies, dendrites, unmyelinated axons, glial cells) surrounded by **white matter** (myelinated axons).
    -   **Grey Matter:**
        -   **Dorsal (Posterior) Horns:** Receive sensory input.
        -   **Ventral (Anterior) Horns:** Contain cell bodies of motor neurons.
        -   (Lateral horns present in thoracic/lumbar regions - autonomic motor neurons).
    -   **White Matter:** Organized into columns (funiculi) containing ascending (sensory) and descending (motor) tracts.
    -   **Spinal Nerves:** Emerge from the cord via dorsal (sensory) and ventral (motor) roots which fuse together.

35. What are the main functions of the spinal cord? (Hint: Information highway, reflex center)
    -   **Conduction Pathway:** Acts as an information highway, transmitting sensory impulses from the body to the brain (ascending tracts) and motor impulses from the brain to the body (descending tracts).
    -   **Reflex Integration Center:** Mediates spinal reflexes â€“ rapid, involuntary responses to stimuli that occur without direct involvement of the brain (e.g., withdrawal reflex).

36. What are ascending and descending tracts in the spinal cord white matter? What kind of information do they generally carry?
    -   **Ascending Tracts:** Composed of sensory axons carrying sensory information *up* the spinal cord *towards* the brain (e.g., touch, pain, temperature, proprioception). Examples: Spinothalamic tracts, Dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway.
    -   **Descending Tracts:** Composed of motor axons carrying motor commands *down* the spinal cord *from* the brain *towards* effectors (muscles, glands). Examples: Corticospinal (pyramidal) tracts, Rubrospinal tract.

37. What are the major regions of the adult brain (cerebrum, diencephalon, brainstem, cerebellum)?
    -   **Cerebrum:** Largest part, responsible for higher mental functions. Divided into two hemispheres.
    -   **Diencephalon:** Located centrally, includes thalamus, hypothalamus, and epithalamus.
    -   **Brainstem:** Connects cerebrum and spinal cord; includes midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. Controls vital autonomic functions.
    -   **Cerebellum:** Located posterior and inferior; coordinates movement, posture, and balance.

38. What are the components of the brainstem (medulla oblongata, pons, midbrain), and what vital functions does it control?
    -   **Components:**
        -   **Medulla Oblongata:** Most inferior part, continuous with spinal cord.
        -   **Pons:** Middle part, bridge between medulla and midbrain, and connects to cerebellum.
        -   **Midbrain:** Most superior part.
    -   **Vital Functions:** Controls essential autonomic behaviors for survival:
        -   **Medulla:** Cardiovascular center (heart rate, blood pressure), respiratory centers (breathing rhythm), vomiting, hiccupping, swallowing, coughing, sneezing.
        -   **Pons:** Helps regulate breathing (along with medulla), relays information between cerebrum and cerebellum.
        -   **Midbrain:** Contains visual and auditory reflex centers, nuclei for cranial nerves III and IV (eye movement).

39. What is the structure and primary function of the cerebellum?
    -   **Structure:** Located dorsal to the pons and medulla. Consists of two hemispheres connected by the vermis. Has a thin outer cortex of grey matter, internal white matter (arbor vitae), and deep grey matter nuclei.
    -   **Primary Function:** Coordinates voluntary muscle movements, ensuring they are smooth, accurate, and timed correctly. Also involved in maintaining posture, balance, and equilibrium. May play roles in cognition and language processing.

40. What structures make up the diencephalon (thalamus, hypothalamus, epithalamus), and what is the key role of each? (Focus on thalamus as relay station, hypothalamus for homeostasis/endocrine link)
    -   **Structures:**
        -   **Thalamus:** Large, egg-shaped structure forming the superolateral walls of the third ventricle.
        -   **Hypothalamus:** Located below the thalamus, forms the inferolateral walls and floor of the third ventricle.
        -   **Epithalamus:** Most dorsal part, forms roof of third ventricle, contains pineal gland.
    -   **Key Roles:**
        -   **Thalamus:** Major **relay station** for sensory information ascending to the cerebral cortex. Sorts, edits, and relays signals. Also involved in motor activities, learning, and memory.
        -   **Hypothalamus:** Main visceral control center crucial for **homeostasis**. Regulates autonomic nervous system, body temperature, food intake, water balance, sleep-wake cycles, and **links the nervous system to the endocrine system** by controlling the pituitary gland.
        -   **Epithalamus (Pineal Gland):** Secretes melatonin, helps regulate sleep-wake cycles (circadian rhythms).

41. What is the cerebrum? Describe its major features (hemispheres, lobes, gyri, sulci, fissures, cerebral cortex, white matter, basal nuclei).
    -   **Definition:** The largest part of the brain, responsible for conscious thought, memory, and complex processing.
    -   **Major Features:**
        -   **Hemispheres:** Divided into right and left cerebral hemispheres by the **longitudinal fissure**.
        -   **Lobes:** Each hemisphere is divided into four main lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital), often named for the overlying skull bones. A fifth lobe, the insula, is deep within the lateral sulcus.
        -   **Gyri (singular: gyrus):** Elevated ridges or folds of tissue on the surface.
        -   **Sulci (singular: sulcus):** Shallow grooves separating gyri.
        -   **Fissures:** Deeper grooves separating larger regions (e.g., longitudinal fissure, transverse cerebral fissure).
        -   **Cerebral Cortex:** The outer layer of grey matter (neuron cell bodies, dendrites, glia, unmyelinated axons); the "conscious mind."
        -   **White Matter:** Internal region composed primarily of myelinated fiber tracts connecting different brain areas.
        -   **Basal Nuclei (Ganglia):** Islands of deep grey matter within the white matter; involved mainly in motor control.

42. What are the four main lobes of the cerebral cortex (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital), and what are the primary functions associated with each?
    -   **Frontal Lobe:** Voluntary motor control, planning, decision making, personality, higher-level cognition, speech production (Broca's area).
    -   **Parietal Lobe:** Processing sensory information (touch, temperature, pain, pressure), spatial awareness, navigation, language comprehension (part of Wernicke's area).
    -   **Temporal Lobe:** Auditory processing, memory formation, object recognition, language comprehension (part of Wernicke's area).
    -   **Occipital Lobe:** Visual processing.

43. How is the cerebral cortex functionally organized? (Distinguish between motor areas, sensory areas, and association areas). Give an example of each.
    -   **Functional Organization:** Divided into three types of functional areas:
        -   **Motor Areas:** Control voluntary movement. Located primarily in the posterior part of the frontal lobe.
            -   *Example:* Primary Motor Cortex (precentral gyrus) - initiates conscious control of skeletal muscles.
        -   **Sensory Areas:** Concerned with conscious awareness of sensation. Located in parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.
            -   *Example:* Primary Somatosensory Cortex (postcentral gyrus) - receives input from skin receptors and proprioceptors.
        -   **Association Areas:** Integrate diverse information for purposeful action. Connect sensory inputs with stored memories and coordinate motor responses. Found throughout the cortex, often adjacent to primary sensory/motor areas.
            -   *Example:* Prefrontal Cortex - involved in intellect, complex learning, recall, personality, working memory, judgment.

44. What is lateralization of cortical function? (Hint: Left vs. Right hemisphere specializations)
    -   **Definition:** The division of labor where each cerebral hemisphere has unique abilities not completely shared by the other. While hemispheres work together, one often dominates specific tasks.
    -   **Specializations (in most right-handed people):**
        -   **Left Hemisphere:** Typically dominant for language (speech, comprehension, writing), math, logic.
        -   **Right Hemisphere:** Typically excels at visual-spatial skills, intuition, emotion, artistic and musical skills, recognizing faces.

45. What roles do the basal nuclei (ganglia) play, particularly regarding movement?
    -   **Role:** Primarily involved in motor control. They receive input from the cerebral cortex, process it, and project back to the cortex (via the thalamus) to influence muscle movements.
    -   **Specific Functions:**
        -   Starting, stopping, and monitoring the intensity of movements executed by the cortex.
        -   Inhibiting antagonistic or unnecessary movements.
        -   Regulating muscle tone.
        -   Play a role in cognition and emotion. (Dysfunction associated with Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases).

46. What is the limbic system? What structures are involved, and what functions (emotion, memory) is it primarily associated with?
    -   **Definition:** A group of structures located on the medial aspect of each cerebral hemisphere and diencephalon; considered the "emotional brain."
    -   **Structures:** Includes parts of the diencephalon (hypothalamus, thalamic nuclei) and cerebral structures (amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, fornix).
    -   **Functions:**
        -   **Emotion:** Mediates emotional responses (e.g., fear via amygdala), links emotions to thoughts.
        -   **Memory:** Involved in processing and forming new memories (especially hippocampus).
        -   Also plays roles in motivation, olfaction (smell), and linking autonomic/endocrine functions to emotional states (via hypothalamus).

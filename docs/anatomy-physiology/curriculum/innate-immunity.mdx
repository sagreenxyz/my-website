# Innate Immunity: The Body's Rapid Response System

**Module 1: Introduction to Innate Immunity**

Defining Innate Immunity:
* What is innate immunity?
* What is its primary characteristic in terms of response time?
* Is it specific or non-specific?
* Does it involve memory?

Components of Innate Immunity:
* List the major components of the innate immune system.

**Module 2: Surface Barriers - The First Line of Defense**

Physical Barriers:
* Describe the role of the skin as a physical barrier.
* Describe the role of mucous membranes lining the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital tracts.

Chemical Barriers:
* Describe the protective functions of secretions like sebum, sweat, saliva, tears, and gastric acid.
* Introduce antimicrobial peptides (e.g., defensins).

**Module 3: Internal Defenses - Cells**

Phagocytes:
* Describe the roles of neutrophils and macrophages in phagocytosis.
* Explain the process of phagocytosis.
* What is chemotaxis?

Natural Killer (NK) Cells:
* Describe the function of NK cells in recognizing and eliminating infected or cancerous cells.
* How do they differ in their mechanism from cytotoxic T cells?

**Module 4: Internal Defenses - Processes**

Inflammatory Response:
* Describe the purpose of the inflammatory response.
* Outline the key events of the inflammatory response:
    * Release of inflammatory chemicals (histamine, kinins, prostaglandins).
    * Vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.
    * Phagocyte mobilization (neutrophil margination, diapedesis, chemotaxis).
* What are the cardinal signs of inflammation?

Antimicrobial Proteins:
* Interferons: Describe their role in antiviral defense.
* Complement System: Describe the complement system and its mechanisms of action (opsonization, inflammation, cytolysis).

**Module 5: Fever - A Systemic Response**

Mechanism of Fever:
* Explain how fever is initiated by pyrogens.
* What is the role of the hypothalamus in regulating body temperature?

Benefits and Risks of Fever:
* Discuss the potential benefits of fever in fighting infection.
* What are the risks associated with high fever?

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Innate Immune Dysfunction**

Defects in Innate Immunity:
* Briefly mention examples of conditions involving defects in innate immune components (e.g., chronic granulomatous disease, complement deficiencies).

Excessive Inflammation:
* Explain how excessive or chronic inflammation can contribute to various diseases.

Pharmacological Modulation:
* Briefly mention drugs that target components of the innate immune system (e.g., anti-inflammatory drugs).

# The Nervous System: Communication and Control

**Module 1: Introduction to the Nervous System**

Defining the Nervous System:
* What is the nervous system? What is its primary role?
* What are the major divisions of the nervous system?

Functions of the Nervous System:
* Describe the three main functions of the nervous system:
    * Sensory Input
    * Integration
    * Motor Output

**Module 2: Central Nervous System (CNS) - The Control Center**

Components of the CNS:
* What are the main components of the CNS?

The Brain:
* Briefly introduce the major regions of the brain (cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem).
* What are some of the general functions associated with each region?

The Spinal Cord:
* Describe the structure and primary function of the spinal cord.

Protection of the CNS:
* Describe the protective structures surrounding the CNS (bones, meninges, cerebrospinal fluid).

**Module 3: Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) - Linking the CNS to the Body**

Components of the PNS:
* What are the main components of the PNS (nerves, ganglia)?

Sensory (Afferent) Division:
* Describe the sensory division and its role in carrying information to the CNS.
* What are sensory receptors?

Motor (Efferent) Division:
* Describe the motor division and its role in carrying commands from the CNS to effectors.
* What are the two main subdivisions of the motor division?

**Module 4: Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) - Involuntary Control**

Divisions of the ANS:
* Describe the two main divisions of the ANS:
    * Sympathetic Division
    * Parasympathetic Division

Functions of the ANS:
* Compare and contrast the general functions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions (fight-or-flight vs. rest-and-digest).
* Provide examples of organs innervated by both divisions and their opposing effects.

**Module 5: Neurons and Neural Signaling**

Neurons: The Functional Units:
* Briefly review the structure of a neuron (cell body, dendrites, axon, synapses).

Action Potentials:
* Briefly review the generation and propagation of action potentials.

Synaptic Transmission:
* Briefly review the process of communication between neurons at synapses (chemical and electrical).

Neurotransmitters:
* Introduce the concept of neurotransmitters and their role in synaptic signaling.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Nervous System Disorders and Function**

Common Neurological Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common neurological disorders (e.g., stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis).

Common Peripheral Nervous System Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common PNS disorders (e.g., neuropathy).

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Briefly mention how drugs can affect the nervous system by influencing neural signaling.

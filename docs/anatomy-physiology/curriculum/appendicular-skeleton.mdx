# The Appendicular Skeleton: Bones of the Limbs and Girdles

**Module 1: Introduction to the Appendicular Skeleton**

Defining the Appendicular Skeleton:
* What are the main components of the appendicular skeleton?
* What are the primary functions of the appendicular skeleton?

Organization of the Appendicular Skeleton:
* Describe the pectoral girdle and its bones.
* Describe the bones of the upper limb (arm, forearm, hand).
* Describe the pelvic girdle and its bones.
* Describe the bones of the lower limb (thigh, leg, foot).

**Module 2: The Pectoral Girdle (Shoulder Girdle)**

Bones of the Pectoral Girdle:
* Name the two bones that form the pectoral girdle and describe their key features and articulations:
    * Clavicle (Collarbone)
    * Scapula (Shoulder Blade)

Functions of the Pectoral Girdle:
* Describe the primary functions of the pectoral girdle, including its role in attaching the upper limb to the axial skeleton and providing flexibility.

**Module 3: Bones of the Upper Limb**

The Arm:
* Name the bone of the arm and describe its key features and articulations:
    * Humerus

The Forearm:
* Name the two bones of the forearm and describe their key features and articulations:
    * Radius
    * Ulna

The Hand:
* Name the three groups of bones in the hand and list the individual bones within each group:
    * Carpals (wrist bones)
    * Metacarpals (bones of the palm)
    * Phalanges (bones of the fingers)

**Module 4: The Pelvic Girdle (Hip Girdle)**

Bones of the Pelvic Girdle:
* Name the three fused bones that form each side of the pelvic girdle and describe their key features and articulations:
    * Ilium
    * Ischium
    * Pubis
* Describe the structure and significance of the bony pelvis, including the sacrum and coccyx.

Functions of the Pelvic Girdle:
* Describe the primary functions of the pelvic girdle, including its role in attaching the lower limb to the axial skeleton and supporting the weight of the upper body.

**Module 5: Bones of the Lower Limb**

The Thigh:
* Name the bone of the thigh and describe its key features and articulations:
    * Femur
    * Patella (Kneecap)

The Leg:
* Name the two bones of the leg and describe their key features and articulations:
    * Tibia
    * Fibula

The Foot:
* Name the three groups of bones in the foot and list the individual bones within each group:
    * Tarsals (ankle bones)
    * Metatarsals (bones of the foot)
    * Phalanges (bones of the toes)

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Disorders of the Appendicular Skeleton**

Common Disorders of the Upper Limb:
* Briefly describe examples of common disorders affecting the bones and joints of the shoulder, arm, forearm, and hand (e.g., fractures, dislocations, carpal tunnel syndrome).

Common Disorders of the Lower Limb:
* Briefly describe examples of common disorders affecting the bones and joints of the hip, thigh, leg, and foot (e.g., fractures, dislocations, osteoarthritis, ankle sprains, plantar fasciitis).

Pharmacological and Clinical Therapies:
* Briefly mention relevant pharmacological and clinical therapies for disorders of the appendicular skeleton.

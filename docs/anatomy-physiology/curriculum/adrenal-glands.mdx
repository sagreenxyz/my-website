# The Adrenal Glands: Stress Response and Metabolic Regulation

**Module 1: Introduction to the Adrenal Glands**

Defining the Adrenal Glands:
* Describe the location and gross anatomy of the adrenal glands.
* Explain the two distinct regions of the adrenal glands and their different hormonal outputs.

**Module 2: The Adrenal Cortex - Steroid Hormone Synthesis**

Layers of the Adrenal Cortex:
* Name the three layers of the adrenal cortex (zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, zona reticularis) and the primary class of hormones produced by each.

Mineralocorticoids (Zona Glomerulosa):
* Describe the primary mineralocorticoid produced (aldosterone).
* Explain the stimuli for aldosterone release and its main target organs and effects (sodium and water reabsorption, potassium excretion).

Glucocorticoids (Zona Fasciculata):
* Describe the primary glucocorticoid produced (cortisol).
* Explain the regulation of cortisol release by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (CRH, ACTH).
* Discuss the major metabolic effects of cortisol (glucose regulation, protein and fat metabolism).
* Explain the role of cortisol in the stress response and its anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive effects.

Gonadocorticoids (Zona Reticularis):
* Describe the primary gonadocorticoids produced (weak androgens).
* What is their significance, particularly in females?

**Module 3: The Adrenal Medulla - Catecholamine Release**

Structure of the Adrenal Medulla:
* Describe the cells of the adrenal medulla (chromaffin cells) and their origin.
* Explain that the adrenal medulla functions as a neuroendocrine organ.

Hormones of the Adrenal Medulla:
* Name the primary hormones released by the adrenal medulla (epinephrine and norepinephrine).
* What stimulates their release (sympathetic nervous system)?

Physiological Effects of Catecholamines:
* Discuss the major effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine on various organ systems during the stress response ("fight-or-flight").

**Module 4: Regulation of Adrenal Hormone Release**

Regulation of Corticosteroids:
* Detail the HPA axis and the negative feedback loops involved in regulating cortisol levels.
* Explain the diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion.
* Describe the regulation of aldosterone release by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and potassium levels.

Regulation of Catecholamines:
* Explain the direct neural control of catecholamine release by the sympathetic nervous system.

**Module 5: Clinical Relevance - Adrenal Disorders - Hyperfunction**

Cushing's Syndrome:
* Describe the causes of Cushing's syndrome (e.g., pituitary adenoma, adrenal tumor, exogenous glucocorticoids).
* List the common signs and symptoms of cortisol excess.

Hyperaldosteronism:
* Describe the causes of hyperaldosteronism (e.g., adrenal adenoma).
* List the common signs and symptoms of aldosterone excess.

Pheochromocytoma:
* Describe the cause of pheochromocytoma (tumor of the adrenal medulla).
* List the common signs and symptoms of catecholamine excess.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Adrenal Disorders - Hypofunction**

Addison's Disease:
* Describe the causes of Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency).
* List the common signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency.

Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency:
* Describe the causes of secondary adrenal insufficiency (e.g., pituitary dysfunction).
* How do the symptoms differ from Addison's disease?

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Provide examples of hormone replacement therapies used to treat adrenal insufficiency.
* Briefly mention drugs used to manage adrenal hyperfunction.

# The Endocrine System: Hormonal Control of Body Functions

**Module 1: Introduction to the Endocrine System**

Defining the Endocrine System:
* What is the endocrine system?
* How does it differ from the nervous system in terms of speed and duration of action?
* What are the primary means of communication in the endocrine system?

Components of the Endocrine System:
* List the major endocrine glands in the body.
* Briefly introduce the concept of hormones and target cells.

**Module 2: Hormones - Chemical Messengers of the Endocrine System**

Defining Hormones:
* What is a hormone?
* How do hormones travel throughout the body?

Chemical Classification of Hormones:
* Describe the two main chemical classes of hormones:
    * Amino acid-based hormones (amines, peptides, proteins)
    * Steroid hormones
* How does their chemical structure affect their synthesis, transport, and interaction with target cells?

Mechanisms of Hormone Action:
* Compare and contrast how water-soluble hormones and lipid-soluble hormones interact with target cells and elicit a response (receptors, second messengers, direct gene activation).

**Module 3: Major Endocrine Glands and Their Hormones - Part 1**

Pituitary Gland (Hypophysis):
* Describe the anatomy of the pituitary gland (anterior and posterior lobes) and its connection to the hypothalamus.
* Anterior Pituitary Hormones: Name the major hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary and describe their primary target organs and effects (e.g., growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, melanocyte-stimulating hormone).
* Posterior Pituitary Hormones: Name the hormones released by the posterior pituitary (synthesized in the hypothalamus) and describe their primary target organs and effects (e.g., antidiuretic hormone, oxytocin).

Thyroid Gland:
* Describe the anatomy of the thyroid gland and the types of hormones it produces.
* Name the major hormones secreted by the thyroid gland and describe their primary target organs and effects (e.g., thyroid hormones T3 and T4, calcitonin).

Parathyroid Glands:
* Describe the location of the parathyroid glands.
* Name the major hormone secreted by the parathyroid glands and describe its primary target organs and effects (parathyroid hormone).

**Module 4: Major Endocrine Glands and Their Hormones - Part 2**

Adrenal Glands:
* Describe the anatomy of the adrenal glands (cortex and medulla).
* Adrenal Cortex Hormones: Name the major hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex and describe their primary target organs and effects (e.g., mineralocorticoids like aldosterone, glucocorticoids like cortisol, gonadocorticoids).
* Adrenal Medulla Hormones: Name the major hormones secreted by the adrenal medulla and describe their primary target organs and effects (epinephrine and norepinephrine).

Pancreas:
* Describe the endocrine function of the pancreas (islets of Langerhans).
* Name the major hormones secreted by the pancreatic islets and describe their primary target organs and effects (insulin and glucagon).

Gonads (Testes and Ovaries):
* Describe the primary endocrine functions of the testes and ovaries.
* Name the major hormones secreted by the testes and ovaries and describe their primary target organs and effects (testosterone, estrogens, progesterone).

Pineal Gland:
* Describe the location of the pineal gland.
* Name the major hormone secreted by the pineal gland and describe its primary target organs and effects (melatonin).

**Module 5: Control of Hormone Release**

Hormonal Stimuli:
* Explain how hormones can stimulate the release of other hormones (tropic hormones).

Humoral Stimuli:
* Explain how changing blood levels of certain ions and nutrients can stimulate hormone release.

Neural Stimuli:
* Explain how nerve fibers can stimulate hormone release (neuroendocrine reflexes).

Feedback Mechanisms:
* Describe negative feedback mechanisms as the primary way hormone levels are regulated. Provide examples.
* Briefly describe positive feedback mechanisms in the endocrine system. Provide examples.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Endocrine Disorders and Pharmacology**

Common Endocrine Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common endocrine disorders related to hyposecretion or hypersecretion of major hormones (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, Addison's disease).

Diagnosis of Endocrine Disorders:
* Briefly mention methods used to diagnose endocrine disorders (e.g., hormone level testing, stimulation/suppression tests, imaging).

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Provide examples of hormone replacement therapies and drugs that block hormone action used to treat endocrine disorders.

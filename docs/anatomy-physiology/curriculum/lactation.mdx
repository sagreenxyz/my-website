Defining Lactation:
* What is lactation?
* What is the physiological purpose of lactation?

Hormonal Control of Lactation:
* What hormones are primarily responsible for lactation?
* What roles do prolactin and oxytocin play in milk production and release?
* How does suckling stimulate milk production?

**Module 2: Stages of Milk Production**

Colostrum:
* What is colostrum? When is it produced?
* What are the key components and benefits of colostrum for the newborn?

Transitional Milk:
* What is transitional milk? When is it produced?
* How does its composition differ from colostrum and mature milk?

Mature Milk:
* What is mature milk? When is it produced?
* What are the key components of mature milk (foremilk and hindmilk) and their functions?
* How does the composition of breast milk change over time to meet the infant's needs?

**Module 3: The Process of Milk Production and Release**

Anatomy of the Mammary Gland:
* Describe the structure of the mammary glands (alveoli, ducts, etc.).

Milk Synthesis:
* Where does milk production occur within the mammary gland?
* Briefly describe the process of milk synthesis.

Milk Ejection (Let-Down Reflex):
* What is the let-down reflex?
* Explain the role of oxytocin in the milk ejection reflex.
* What factors can influence the let-down reflex?

**Module 4: Benefits of Breastfeeding**

Nutritional Benefits for the Infant:
* Why is breast milk considered the ideal food for infants?
* What are the key nutrients in breast milk and their roles in infant growth and development?
* How does breast milk adapt to the changing needs of the growing infant?

Immunological Benefits for the Infant:
* How does breastfeeding provide passive immunity to the infant?
* What antibodies are present in breast milk, and what infections do they help protect against?
* What are the long-term immunological benefits of breastfeeding?

Benefits for the Mother:
* What are the physiological benefits of breastfeeding for the mother (e.g., uterine involution, postpartum weight loss)?
* How does breastfeeding reduce the risk of certain diseases in the mother (e.g., breast and ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes)?
* What are the psychological and emotional benefits of breastfeeding for the mother-infant bond?

**Module 5: Common Breastfeeding Challenges**

Nipple Pain and Soreness:
* What are the common causes of nipple pain and soreness during breastfeeding?
* How can proper latch and positioning help prevent and manage nipple pain?

Engorgement:
* What is breast engorgement?
* What causes engorgement, and how can it be managed?

Mastitis:
* What is mastitis?
* What are the symptoms, causes, and treatment of mastitis?

Low Milk Supply:
* What are the potential causes of low milk supply?
* What strategies can be used to increase milk production (e.g., frequent nursing/pumping, proper hydration and nutrition)?

Other Challenges:
* Briefly discuss other common breastfeeding challenges (e.g., plugged ducts, thrush).

**Module 6: Pharmacological Interventions Related to Lactation**

Galactagogues:
* What are galactagogues?
* What medications may be used to increase milk supply?
* What are the potential risks and benefits of using galactagogues?
* Briefly mention herbal galactagogues.

Lactation Suppression:
* What medications are used to suppress lactation?
* When might lactation suppression be necessary or desired?

**Module 7: Clinical Relevance: Supporting Breastfeeding Mothers**

The Role of Healthcare Professionals:
* What is the role of healthcare professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, lactation consultants) in supporting breastfeeding mothers?

Breastfeeding Resources and Support Groups:
* What resources and support groups are available to breastfeeding mothers?

Promoting Breastfeeding-Friendly Practices:
* What are breastfeeding-friendly practices in hospitals and communities?

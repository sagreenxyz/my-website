# Anatomy of the Nephron and Physiology of Urine Formation

**Module 1: Introduction to the Nephron**

Defining the Nephron:
* What is the nephron?
* Why is it considered the functional unit of the kidney?
* Approximately how many nephrons are in each kidney?

Components of the Nephron:
* List the two main parts of a nephron.

**Module 2: The Renal Corpuscle: Filtration**

Glomerulus:
* Describe the glomerulus. What type of capillaries are found here?
* What is the role of the glomerulus in urine formation?

Bowman's Capsule (Glomerular Capsule):
* Describe the structure of Bowman's capsule (parietal and visceral layers).
* What are podocytes and filtration slits?
* What is the capsular space?

Filtration Membrane:
* Describe the components of the filtration membrane (glomerular endothelium, basement membrane, podocytes).
* What substances are filtered from the blood into Bowman's capsule?
* What substances are typically not filtered?

**Module 3: The Renal Tubule: Reabsorption and Secretion**

Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT):
* Describe the structure of the PCT (epithelial cells, microvilli).
* What are the primary functions of the PCT?
* List key substances reabsorbed in the PCT.

Nephron Loop (Loop of Henle):
* Describe the structure of the nephron loop (descending limb, ascending limb - thin and thick segments).
* What is the primary function of the nephron loop?
* Explain the role of the nephron loop in establishing the medullary osmotic gradient.

Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT):
* Describe the structure of the DCT (epithelial cells, fewer microvilli than PCT).
* What are the primary functions of the DCT?
* Explain the role of the DCT in selective reabsorption and secretion (influenced by hormones).

Collecting Duct:
* Describe the structure of the collecting duct (principal cells, intercalated cells).
* What are the primary functions of the collecting duct?
* Explain the role of the collecting duct in regulating water reabsorption (ADH) and acid-base balance.

**Module 4: Glomerular Filtration: The First Step of Urine Formation**

Forces Driving Filtration:
* Explain glomerular hydrostatic pressure, capsular hydrostatic pressure, and blood colloid osmotic pressure.
* What is net filtration pressure (NFP)?

Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR):
* Define GFR.
* What is the normal GFR?
* Explain the factors that influence GFR.

Regulation of GFR:
* Briefly describe the intrinsic (renal autoregulation: myogenic mechanism, tubuloglomerular feedback) and extrinsic (neural and hormonal) mechanisms that regulate GFR.

**Module 5: Tubular Reabsorption: Recovering Essential Substances**

Mechanisms of Reabsorption:
* Describe the different transport mechanisms involved in tubular reabsorption (passive and active transport, facilitated diffusion, osmosis).
* Explain transcellular and paracellular routes.

Reabsorption in Specific Tubule Segments:
* Detail the reabsorption of water, glucose, amino acids, sodium, chloride, potassium, bicarbonate, and urea in the PCT, loop of Henle, DCT, and collecting duct.

Transport Maximum:
* Explain the concept of transport maximum ($T_m$) and its relevance to substances like glucose.

**Module 6: Tubular Secretion: Eliminating Additional Wastes**

Mechanisms of Secretion:
* Describe the active transport mechanisms involved in tubular secretion.

Secretion in Specific Tubule Segments:
* Detail the secretion of hydrogen ions, potassium ions, creatinine, urea, uric acid, and certain drugs in the PCT, DCT, and collecting duct.

**Module 7: Clinical Relevance: Nephron Function and Renal Disorders**

Impact of Nephron Damage:
* Explain how damage to nephrons affects kidney function and urine formation.

Common Renal Disorders:
* Briefly mention examples of common renal disorders affecting nephron function (e.g., glomerulonephritis, tubular necrosis).

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Briefly discuss how drugs can affect different aspects of nephron function (e.g., diuretics affecting reabsorption).

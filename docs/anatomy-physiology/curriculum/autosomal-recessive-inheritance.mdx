# Autosomal Recessive Inheritance

**Module 1: Introduction to Autosomal Recessive Inheritance**

Defining Autosomal Recessive Inheritance:
* What does "autosomal" mean in the context of inheritance?
* What does "recessive" mean in the context of alleles and phenotype expression?
* In autosomal recessive inheritance, how many copies of the recessive allele are needed for the trait to be expressed?

Key Characteristics:
* List the key characteristics that often indicate an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance in pedigrees.

**Module 2: Genotypes and Phenotypes in Autosomal Recessive Inheritance**

Dominant Allele (A) and Recessive Allele (a):
* Explain the possible genotypes for an autosomal recessive trait (AA, Aa, aa).
* Which genotype will express the recessive phenotype?
* Which genotypes will express the dominant phenotype?

Homozygous Dominant (AA):
* Describe the phenotype of an individual with a homozygous dominant genotype.
* Can individuals with this genotype pass on the recessive allele?

Heterozygous (Aa):
* Describe the phenotype of an individual with a heterozygous genotype.
* What is a carrier? Explain why heterozygotes are carriers for autosomal recessive traits.
* What is the probability of a carrier passing on the recessive allele?

Homozygous Recessive (aa):
* Describe the phenotype of an individual with a homozygous recessive genotype.
* What alleles will individuals with this genotype pass on to their offspring?

**Module 3: Pedigree Analysis of Autosomal Recessive Traits**

Identifying Autosomal Recessive Patterns:
* Explain how to recognize an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern in a pedigree.
* What are some typical features to look for (e.g., affected individuals often have unaffected parents, trait may skip generations)?

Example Pedigree Analysis:
* Analyze a sample pedigree illustrating autosomal recessive inheritance, tracing the transmission of the trait through multiple generations.
* Determine the possible genotypes of individuals in the pedigree based on their phenotypes and family history, including identifying carriers.

**Module 4: Examples of Autosomal Recessive Disorders**

Cystic Fibrosis (CF):
* Briefly describe cystic fibrosis and its inheritance pattern.

Sickle Cell Anemia:
* Briefly describe sickle cell anemia and its inheritance pattern.

Phenylketonuria (PKU):
* Briefly describe phenylketonuria and its inheritance pattern.

Tay-Sachs Disease:
* Briefly describe Tay-Sachs disease and its inheritance pattern.

**Module 5: Consanguinity and Autosomal Recessive Disorders**

What is Consanguinity?
* Define consanguinity (inbreeding).

Increased Risk of Recessive Disorders:
* Explain why consanguineous relationships increase the risk of offspring inheriting autosomal recessive disorders.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance: Autosomal Recessive Disorders**

Diagnosis and Genetic Testing:
* Briefly discuss how autosomal recessive disorders are diagnosed, including the role of genetic testing and carrier screening.

Genetic Counseling:
* Explain the importance of genetic counseling for individuals with autosomal recessive disorders and for carriers who are planning families, including risk assessment for offspring.

Management and Treatment:
* Briefly mention the general approaches to managing autosomal recessive disorders.

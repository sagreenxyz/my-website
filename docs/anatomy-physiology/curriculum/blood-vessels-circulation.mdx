# Blood Vessels and Circulation: The Body's Transport Network

**Module 1: Introduction to Blood Vessels**

Types of Blood Vessels:
* List the three main types of blood vessels and their primary functions.

Structure of Blood Vessel Walls:
* Describe the three layers (tunics) common to most blood vessels (tunica intima, tunica media, tunica externa) and their composition.

**Module 2: Arteries - Carrying Blood Away from the Heart**

Structure of Arteries:
* Describe the structural characteristics of arteries that allow them to withstand high pressure.
* Distinguish between elastic arteries, muscular arteries, and arterioles in terms of size and function.

Function of Arteries:
* Explain the role of arteries in conducting blood away from the heart.
* Describe the concept of elastic recoil and its importance in maintaining blood flow.
* How do arterioles regulate blood flow to capillary beds?

**Module 3: Capillaries - Sites of Exchange**

Structure of Capillaries:
* Describe the structural characteristics of capillaries that facilitate exchange.
* Distinguish between continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoidal capillaries and their locations and functions.

Function of Capillaries:
* Explain the process of capillary exchange (diffusion, transcytosis, bulk flow).
* What factors influence the movement of substances across capillary walls?

**Module 4: Veins - Returning Blood to the Heart**

Structure of Veins:
* Describe the structural characteristics of veins. How do they differ from arteries?
* Distinguish between venules and veins.

Function of Veins:
* Explain the role of veins in returning blood to the heart.
* Describe the mechanisms that assist venous return (skeletal muscle pump, respiratory pump, valves).

**Module 5: Systemic and Pulmonary Circulation**

Systemic Circulation:
* Describe the pathway of blood in the systemic circulation, including major arteries branching from the aorta and major veins returning to the heart.

Pulmonary Circulation:
* Describe the pathway of blood in the pulmonary circulation.

Differences Between Systemic and Pulmonary Circulation:
* Compare and contrast the pressure and resistance in systemic and pulmonary circulation.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Vascular Disorders and Circulation**

Common Vascular Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common vascular disorders (e.g., atherosclerosis, hypertension, varicose veins, deep vein thrombosis).

Factors Affecting Circulation:
* Discuss factors that can influence blood flow and circulation (e.g., blood viscosity, vessel diameter, blood pressure).

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Provide examples of drugs used to treat vascular disorders and affect circulation (e.g., antihypertensives, vasodilators, anticoagulants).

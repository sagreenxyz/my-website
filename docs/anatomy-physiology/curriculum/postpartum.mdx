**Module 1: Introduction to the Postpartum Period**

Defining the Postpartum Period:
* What is the postpartum period? How long does it typically last?
* What are the major physiological systems that undergo significant changes during this time?
* What are the primary goals of the maternal body in the postpartum period?

**Module 2: Uterine Involution and Lochia**

Uterine Involution:
* Describe the process of uterine involution. What factors facilitate this process?
* How does the size and location of the uterus change in the days and weeks following delivery?
* What are afterpains (postpartum uterine contractions)?

Lochia:
* What is lochia? Describe the different types and their expected progression (lochia rubra, serosa, alba).
* What is the typical duration of lochia?

**Module 3: Cervical and Vaginal Changes**

Cervical Changes:
* Describe the immediate appearance of the cervix after delivery.
* How long does it take for the cervix to regain its pre-pregnant form?

Vaginal Changes:
* Describe the common changes in the vagina after delivery (e.g., stretching, minor lacerations).
* How does the vagina gradually return to its pre-pregnant state?

**Module 4: Cardiovascular System Adjustments**

Blood Volume and Cardiac Output:
* Describe the initial changes in blood volume and cardiac output after delivery.
* How do these parameters gradually return to pre-pregnant levels?

Blood Pressure:
* What are the typical blood pressure changes in the postpartum period?

Hemostasis and Coagulation:
* Discuss the increased risk of thromboembolism in the postpartum period.

**Module 5: Endocrine System Changes and Lactation**

Hormonal Shifts:
* Describe the rapid decline in placental hormones (hCG, estrogen, progesterone) after delivery.
* Discuss the changes in pituitary hormones (prolactin, oxytocin).

Lactation:
* Explain the hormonal control of milk production (prolactin) and milk ejection (oxytocin).
* Briefly describe the stages of milk production (colostrum, transitional milk, mature milk).

Resumption of Ovulation and Menstruation:
* Discuss the timeline for the return of ovulation and menstruation in non-lactating and lactating women.

**Module 6: Urinary and Gastrointestinal System Changes**

Urinary System:
* Describe common urinary changes in the early postpartum period (e.g., diuresis, urinary retention).
* How does bladder tone return?

Gastrointestinal System:
* Describe common gastrointestinal changes (e.g., constipation) and the return of bowel function.

**Module 7: Psychological and Emotional Adjustments**

"Baby Blues":
* Describe the "baby blues" and their typical characteristics and duration.

Postpartum Depression:
* Briefly introduce postpartum depression as a more serious and prolonged mood disorder.

Maternal Bonding and Attachment:

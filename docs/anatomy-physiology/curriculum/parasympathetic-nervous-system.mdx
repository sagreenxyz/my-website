# The Parasympathetic Nervous System: Promoting Rest and Digestion

**Module 1: Introduction to the Parasympathetic Nervous System**

Defining the Parasympathetic Division:
* What is the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS)?
* What is its general role in the body during relaxed states?
* It is often referred to as the "rest-and-digest" or "feed-and-breed" system. Explain why.

Overview of Parasympathetic Functions:
* List the major physiological changes that occur when the parasympathetic nervous system is activated.

**Module 2: Anatomical Features of the Parasympathetic Division**

Origin of Preganglionic Neurons:
* Where in the central nervous system (CNS) do preganglionic parasympathetic neurons originate? (brainstem and sacral region of the spinal cord - craniosacral outflow)

Cranial Nerves Involved:
* Name the cranial nerves that carry preganglionic parasympathetic fibers (Oculomotor III, Facial VII, Glossopharyngeal IX, Vagus X).
* Briefly describe the general targets innervated by each of these nerves.

Sacral Outflow:
* Describe the origin of preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the sacral spinal cord (S2-S4).
* What organs in the pelvic region do these fibers primarily innervate?

Location of Ganglia:
* Where are parasympathetic ganglia typically located relative to their target organs? (terminal ganglia - near or within the walls of the organs)

Pathways of Postganglionic Fibers:
* Explain that postganglionic parasympathetic fibers are typically short and synapse with effector cells within the target organ.

**Module 3: Neurotransmitters and Receptors in the Parasympathetic Division**

Preganglionic Neurons:
* What neurotransmitter is released by preganglionic parasympathetic neurons?
* What type of receptor is found on postganglionic parasympathetic neurons?

Postganglionic Neurons:
* What is the primary neurotransmitter released by postganglionic parasympathetic neurons?
* What are cholinergic receptors? List and briefly describe the main types (nicotinic and muscarinic) and their general effects.

**Module 4: Effects of Parasympathetic Activation on Target Organs**

Cardiovascular System:
* Describe the effects of parasympathetic stimulation on heart rate and blood vessels.

Respiratory System:
* Describe the effects of parasympathetic stimulation on bronchioles and mucus secretion.

Digestive System:
* Describe the effects of parasympathetic stimulation on digestive motility and secretions.

Urinary System:
* Describe the effects of parasympathetic stimulation on bladder function.

Eyes:
* Describe the effects of parasympathetic stimulation on pupils and lens accommodation.

Glands:
* Describe the effects of parasympathetic stimulation on salivary, lacrimal, and other exocrine glands.

**Module 5: Control of the Parasympathetic Division**

Integration Centers:
* Identify the main brain regions involved in regulating parasympathetic activity (e.g., hypothalamus, brainstem nuclei).

Reflex Pathways:
* Describe examples of parasympathetic reflexes (e.g., baroreceptor reflex, defecation reflex, urination reflex).

Influence of Higher Brain Centers:
* Explain how emotions and conscious thought can influence parasympathetic activity.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Disorders and Pharmacology of the Parasympathetic Division**

Disorders of Parasympathetic Function:
* Briefly describe examples of disorders involving parasympathetic dysfunction (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention).

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Provide examples of drugs that mimic or block parasympathetic effects (cholinergics/muscarinic agonists and anticholinergics/muscarinic antagonists) and their clinical uses.

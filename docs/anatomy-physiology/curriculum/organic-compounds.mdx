# Organic Compounds in Biological Systems

**Module 1: Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry**

Defining Organic Compounds:
* What are organic compounds? What is the defining characteristic that distinguishes them from inorganic compounds?
* Explain the unique properties of carbon that allow it to form a vast diversity of organic molecules (e.g., tetravalence, ability to form long chains and rings).
* What are hydrocarbons? Why are they considered the simplest organic compounds?

Functional Groups:
* What are functional groups? Explain their importance in determining the chemical properties and reactivity of organic molecules.
* Identify and describe the key functional groups found in biological molecules (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate). Provide examples of molecules containing these groups.

Isomers:
* What are isomers? Briefly describe the different types of isomers (structural, geometric, enantiomers) and their significance in biological systems.

**Module 2: Carbohydrates: Energy and Structure**

Monosaccharides:
* What are monosaccharides? List some common monosaccharides found in the body (e.g., glucose, fructose, galactose) and describe their basic structures and functions.

Disaccharides:
* What are disaccharides? How are they formed from monosaccharides? List important disaccharides (e.g., sucrose, lactose, maltose) and their roles.

Polysaccharides:
* What are polysaccharides? How are they formed from monosaccharides? Describe the structures and functions of key polysaccharides in the body (e.g., glycogen, starch, cellulose).

Clinical Relevance of Carbohydrates:
* Discuss the importance of glucose as a primary energy source.
* Explain the role of insulin in glucose metabolism and the implications of diabetes mellitus.
* Briefly discuss dietary sources of carbohydrates and their impact on health.

**Module 3: Lipids: Fats, Oils, and Steroids**

Triglycerides (Fats and Oils):
* Describe the structure of triglycerides and their primary function in energy storage.
* Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and their effects on the properties of fats and oils.
* Discuss the importance of lipids in insulation and protection.

Phospholipids:
* Describe the structure of phospholipids and their crucial role as the main component of cell membranes. Explain their amphipathic nature.

Steroids:
* Describe the basic structure of steroids. List important steroids in the body (e.g., cholesterol, steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen) and their diverse functions.

Eicosanoids:
* What are eicosanoids? Briefly describe their roles in inflammation, blood clotting, and other physiological processes.

Clinical Relevance of Lipids:
* Discuss the role of cholesterol in cardiovascular disease.
* Explain the importance of essential fatty acids in the diet.
* Briefly discuss the functions of steroid hormones in regulating various bodily processes.

**Module 4: Proteins: Diverse Functions**

Amino Acids:
* What are the building blocks of proteins? Describe the basic structure of an amino acid.
* Explain the significance of the R-group (side chain) in determining the properties and function of different amino acids.
* List the major categories of amino acids (e.g., nonpolar, polar, acidic, basic).

Protein Structure:
* Describe the four levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary) and the types of bonds involved in maintaining each level.
* Explain the importance of protein folding for proper function.

Protein Functions:
* Discuss the diverse roles of proteins in the body, including:
    * Enzymes (catalysis)
    * Structural components (e.g., collagen, keratin)
    * Transport (e.g., hemoglobin, membrane channels)
    * Contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin)
    * Hormones (regulation)
    * Antibodies (immunity)

Clinical Relevance of Proteins:
* Discuss the implications of protein denaturation and misfolding in disease.
* Explain the role of enzymes as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.
* Briefly discuss the importance of dietary protein.

**Module 5: Nucleic Acids: Information Storage and Transfer**

Nucleotides:
* What are the building blocks of nucleic acids? Describe the three components of a nucleotide (sugar, phosphate group, nitrogenous base).

DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):
* Describe the structure of DNA (double helix, base pairing rules).
* Explain the role of DNA in storing genetic information and its importance in heredity.

RNA (Ribonucleic Acid):
* Describe the basic structure of RNA and its different types (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA).
* Explain the roles of different types of RNA in protein synthesis.

ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate):
* Describe the structure of ATP and its crucial role as the primary energy currency of the cell.
* Explain how ATP stores and releases energy through the breaking and formation of phosphate bonds.

Clinical Relevance of Nucleic Acids:
* Discuss the role of DNA mutations in genetic disorders and cancer.
* Explain the principles behind DNA-based diagnostic tests.
* Briefly discuss the mechanisms of action of some antiviral and anticancer drugs that target nucleic acid synthesis or function.

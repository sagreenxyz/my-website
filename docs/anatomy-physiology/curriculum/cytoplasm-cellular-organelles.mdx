# Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles: The Cell's Interior

**Module 1: Introduction to the Cytoplasm**

Defining the Cytoplasm:
* What is the cytoplasm? Where is it located within the cell?
* What are the two main components of the cytoplasm?
    * **Cytosol:** Describe the cytosol. What is its composition (water, ions, nutrients, proteins, etc.)? What types of metabolic reactions occur in the cytosol?
    * **Organelles:** What are organelles? How are they different from the cytosol?

General Functions of the Cytoplasm:
* Briefly list the major functions of the cytoplasm:
    * Providing a medium for metabolic reactions.
    * Suspending and supporting organelles.
    * Facilitating transport of substances within the cell.
    * Maintaining cell shape (through the cytoskeleton).

**Module 2: Non-Membranous Organelles**

Ribosomes: Protein Synthesis Factories:
* Describe the structure of ribosomes (small and large subunits, composed of ribosomal RNA and protein).
* Distinguish between free ribosomes and bound ribosomes. What types of proteins are synthesized by each?
* Explain the process of protein synthesis (translation) and the role of ribosomes.

Cytoskeleton: Structural Framework:
* Describe the three main types of protein filaments that make up the cytoskeleton:
    * **Microfilaments (Actin Filaments):** Structure, functions (muscle contraction, cell motility, cell shape).
    * **Intermediate Filaments:** Structure, functions (mechanical strength, resisting stress).
    * **Microtubules (Tubulin Filaments):** Structure, functions (cell shape, chromosome movement during cell division, intracellular transport).
* Explain the dynamic nature of the cytoskeleton.

Centrosomes and Centrioles: Organizing Microtubules:
* Describe the structure of a centrosome and its role as the main microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in animal cells.
* Describe the structure of centrioles and their role in cell division (formation of the mitotic spindle) and the formation of cilia and flagella.

**Module 3: Membranous Organelles: The Endomembrane System**

Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): Manufacturing and Transport Hub:
* **Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER):** Structure (network of membranes with attached ribosomes), functions (protein synthesis and modification, membrane production).
* **Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER):** Structure (network of membranes lacking ribosomes), functions (lipid synthesis, detoxification, calcium storage).

Golgi Apparatus (Golgi Complex): Processing and Packaging Center:
* Describe the structure of the Golgi apparatus (stacks of flattened sacs called cisternae).
* Explain the three functional regions (cis, medial, trans faces) and the process of protein and lipid modification, sorting, and packaging into vesicles.

Lysosomes: Recycling and Waste Disposal:
* Describe the structure of lysosomes (membrane-bound sacs containing hydrolytic enzymes).
* Explain the functions of lysosomes in intracellular digestion, autophagy, and programmed cell death (apoptosis).

Peroxisomes: Detoxification Centers:
* Describe the structure of peroxisomes (membrane-bound sacs containing oxidative enzymes).
* Explain the functions of peroxisomes in detoxification (e.g., breakdown of hydrogen peroxide) and fatty acid metabolism.

**Module 4: Membranous Organelles: Energy Production**

Mitochondria: Powerhouses of the Cell:
* Describe the structure of mitochondria (double membrane, cristae, matrix).
* Explain the process of cellular respiration (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, electron transport chain) and the role of mitochondria in ATP production.
* Discuss the concept of mitochondrial DNA and the endosymbiotic theory.

**Module 5: Membranous Organelles: Storage and Other Functions**

Vacuoles: Storage and More (Especially in Plants):
* Describe the structure and diverse functions of vacuoles, particularly the large central vacuole in plant cells (storage of water, nutrients, waste; turgor pressure).
* Briefly mention vacuoles in animal cells (smaller, involved in various functions like storage and transport).

Nucleus: Control Center of the Cell:
* While often considered separately, the nucleus is a key membranous organelle containing the cell's genetic material (DNA) and controlling cellular activities. Its structure and function will likely be covered in more detail elsewhere.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance: Organelle Dysfunction and Disease**

Lysosomal Storage Diseases:
* Discuss how defects in lysosomal enzymes can lead to the accumulation of undigested materials, causing lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease).

Mitochondrial Diseases:
* Explain how mutations in mitochondrial DNA can result in mitochondrial diseases affecting energy production and various organ systems.

Peroxisomal Disorders:
* Briefly mention disorders resulting from defects in peroxisomal enzymes (e.g., Zellweger syndrome).

Drug Targeting of Organelles:
* Explain how some drugs specifically target certain organelles to exert their therapeutic effects (e.g., some antibiotics targeting bacterial ribosomes, chemotherapy drugs affecting the nucleus or mitochondria of cancer cells).

Organelle Involvement in Disease Processes:
* Discuss the role of organelles (e.g., ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction) in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.

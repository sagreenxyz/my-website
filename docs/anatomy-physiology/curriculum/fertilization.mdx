# Fertilization: The Union of Sperm and Egg

**Module 1: Introduction to Fertilization**

Defining Fertilization:
* What is fertilization (conception)?
* What are the primary goals of fertilization?

Timing of Fertilization:
* Discuss the fertile window in the female menstrual cycle.
* How long can sperm survive in the female reproductive tract?
* How long is an oocyte viable after ovulation?

**Module 2: Sperm Transport and Capacitation**

Sperm Journey:
* Describe the journey of sperm from the vagina to the uterine tubes.
* What factors aid sperm motility?

Capacitation:
* What is capacitation? Where does it occur?
* Explain the changes that sperm undergo during capacitation that enable fertilization.

**Module 3: Sperm Penetration of the Oocyte**

Penetration of the Corona Radiata:
* Describe how sperm penetrate the corona radiata (layers of follicular cells surrounding the oocyte).
* What role does hyaluronidase play?

Penetration of the Zona Pellucida:
* Describe how sperm bind to and penetrate the zona pellucida (glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte).
* What is the acrosomal reaction and its importance?
* Explain the role of enzymes released from the acrosome.

Fusion of Sperm and Oocyte Plasma Membranes:
* Describe the fusion of the sperm and oocyte plasma membranes.

**Module 4: Blocks to Polyspermy**

What is Polyspermy?
* Define polyspermy and explain why it is detrimental to normal embryonic development.

Fast Block to Polyspermy:
* Describe the fast block to polyspermy involving changes in the oocyte's membrane potential.

Slow Block to Polyspermy (Cortical Reaction):
* Describe the slow block to polyspermy involving the release of cortical granules and changes in the zona pellucida.
* What is the zona reaction?

**Module 5: Completion of Meiosis II and Pronucleus Formation**

Oocyte Activation:
* Describe the activation of the oocyte upon sperm entry.

Completion of Meiosis II:
* Explain when the oocyte completes meiosis II.
* What are the products of meiosis II in the oocyte?

Pronucleus Formation:
* Describe the formation of the male and female pronuclei.

**Module 6: Syngamy and the Start of Development**

Syngamy:
* What is syngamy?
* Describe the fusion of the male and female pronuclei.
* What is the result of syngamy?

The First Mitotic Cleavage:
* Briefly mention the first cell division of the zygote.

**Module 7: Clinical Relevance - Fertilization Issues**

Infertility:
* Briefly discuss factors that can impair fertilization in males and females.

Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART):
* Briefly mention examples of ART that assist fertilization (e.g., in vitro fertilization - IVF, intracytoplasmic sperm injection - ICSI).

Ethical Considerations:
* Briefly mention some ethical considerations related to assisted fertilization.

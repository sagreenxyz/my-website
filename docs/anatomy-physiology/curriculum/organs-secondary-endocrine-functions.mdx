# Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions

**Module 1: Introduction to Secondary Endocrine Functions**

Defining Secondary Endocrine Functions:
* What does it mean for an organ to have a secondary endocrine function?
* How do these functions differ from the primary roles of these organs?
* Why is it important to understand these secondary endocrine roles?

**Module 2: The Heart: Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)**

Primary Function:
* Briefly review the primary function of the heart (pumping blood).

Secondary Endocrine Function:
* Identify the hormone produced by the heart (atrial natriuretic peptide - ANP).
* Describe the stimuli for ANP release (increased blood volume/pressure).
* Explain the effects of ANP on the kidneys and blood vessels in regulating blood volume and pressure.

**Module 3: The Kidneys: Erythropoietin (EPO) and Renin**

Primary Function:
* Briefly review the primary functions of the kidneys (filtering blood, waste removal, fluid balance).

Secondary Endocrine Functions:
* Identify the two main hormones with endocrine functions produced by the kidneys:
    * Erythropoietin (EPO): Describe the stimuli for EPO release and its target organ and effect (red blood cell production in bone marrow).
    * Renin: Describe the stimuli for renin release and its role as an enzyme in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to regulate blood pressure and fluid balance.

**Module 4: The Digestive System: Enteroendocrine Cells**

Primary Function:
* Briefly review the primary function of the digestive system (digestion and absorption of nutrients).

Secondary Endocrine Functions:
* Explain the presence of enteroendocrine cells scattered throughout the lining of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
* Provide examples of hormones produced by enteroendocrine cells and their functions:
    * Gastrin (stomach)
    * Secretin (small intestine)
    * Cholecystokinin (CCK) (small intestine)
    * Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) (small intestine)

**Module 5: Adipose Tissue: Leptin and Adiponectin**

Primary Function:
* Briefly review the primary function of adipose tissue (energy storage).

Secondary Endocrine Functions:
* Identify the hormones with endocrine functions produced by adipose tissue:
    * Leptin: Describe its role in regulating appetite and energy expenditure.
    * Adiponectin: Describe its roles in insulin sensitivity and anti-inflammatory effects.

**Module 6: Other Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions**

The Skeleton:
* Briefly mention osteocalcin and its potential roles in glucose metabolism and testosterone production.

The Thymus:
* Briefly mention thymic hormones (thymosins, thymopoietins) and their role in immune system development.

The Skin:
* Briefly mention the role of the skin in vitamin D synthesis (a hormone precursor).

The Placenta:
* Briefly mention the placenta's role in producing hormones during pregnancy (e.g., human chorionic gonadotropin - hCG, estrogens, progesterone).

# Cellular Level of Organization

**Module 1: The Basic Unit of Life**

Defining the Cell:
* What is a cell? Why is it considered the fundamental unit of life?
* Briefly discuss the Cell Theory. What are its main tenets?

Basic Cell Structures:
* Draw and label the major components of a generalized human cell, including the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus.
* Briefly describe the primary function of each of these main components.

The Plasma Membrane: The Cell's Outer Boundary:
* Describe the structure of the plasma membrane, including the phospholipid bilayer, cholesterol, and membrane proteins.
* Explain the various functions of the plasma membrane, such as selective permeability, communication, and cell signaling.

**Module 2: Cytoplasm and Organelles**

Cytosol and Organelles:
* What is the cytoplasm? What are its two main components?
* Define organelles. What is the advantage of having membrane-bound organelles in eukaryotic cells?

Key Organelles and Their Functions:
* Describe the structure and primary function(s) of the following organelles:
    * Nucleus (including the nucleolus and nuclear envelope)
    * Ribosomes (free and bound)
    * Endoplasmic Reticulum (rough and smooth)
    * Golgi Apparatus
    * Mitochondria
    * Lysosomes
    * Peroxisomes
    * Cytoskeleton (microfilaments, intermediate filaments, microtubules)
    * Centrosomes and Centrioles

**Module 3: Cellular Transport**

Movement Across the Plasma Membrane:
* Explain the concept of selective permeability of the plasma membrane.
* Compare and contrast passive transport and active transport.

Passive Transport Mechanisms:
* Describe the following passive transport processes and provide examples of substances transported via each:
    * Simple diffusion
    * Facilitated diffusion
    * Osmosis (including the concepts of isotonic, hypertonic, and hypotonic solutions)

Active Transport Mechanisms:
* Describe the following active transport processes and explain the role of ATP:
    * Primary active transport (e.g., sodium-potassium pump)
    * Secondary active transport (symporters and antiporters)

Vesicular Transport:
* Describe the processes of endocytosis (phagocytosis, pinocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis) and exocytosis.

**Module 4: Cell Growth, Division, and Differentiation**

The Cell Life Cycle:
* Describe the main phases of the cell cycle (interphase and mitotic phase).
* Briefly explain the events that occur during each stage of interphase (G1, S, G2).

Cell Division: Mitosis and Cytokinesis:
* Describe the stages of mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase) and the key events that occur in each.
* Explain the process of cytokinesis in animal cells.

Cellular Differentiation: Specialization:
* What is cell differentiation?
* Explain how cells with the same genetic material can become specialized to perform different functions.
* Provide examples of differentiated cell types and their unique characteristics (e.g., neuron, muscle cell).

**Module 5: Clinical Relevance: Cellular Dysfunction and Therapies**

Cellular Injury and Disease:
* Explain how damage or dysfunction at the cellular level can lead to various diseases and conditions (e.g., infections, genetic disorders, cancer).
* Provide examples of diseases that result from specific cellular abnormalities (e.g., cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia).

Pharmacological Interventions Targeting Cellular Processes:
* Discuss how many drugs exert their effects by interacting with specific cellular structures or processes. Provide examples of drugs that target:
    * Cell membranes (e.g., some anesthetics)
    * Cellular receptors (e.g., hormone agonists/antagonists)
    * Enzymes within cells (e.g., metabolic inhibitors)
    * DNA replication or protein synthesis (e.g., some chemotherapy drugs, antibiotics)
    * Ion channels (e.g., calcium channel blockers)
* Explain the importance of understanding normal cellular function to develop effective pharmacological therapies.

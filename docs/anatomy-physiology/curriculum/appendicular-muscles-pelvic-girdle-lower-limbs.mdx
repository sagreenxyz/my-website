# Appendicular Muscles: Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limbs

**Module 1: Introduction to Muscles of the Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limb**

Defining the Region:
* What are the primary functions of the muscles of the pelvic girdle and lower limb?
* How do these muscles facilitate locomotion, stability, and posture?
* Briefly review the bones of the pelvic girdle and lower limb.

Organization of Lower Limb Muscles:
* Describe the major muscle groups of the hip, thigh, leg, and foot.

**Module 2: Muscles of the Pelvic Girdle Acting on the Thigh**

Gluteal Muscles:
* Name the major gluteal muscles (gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus) and describe their primary actions.
* What is the iliotibial (IT) band and which muscle is associated with it?

Lateral Rotators of the Hip:
* Name the deep lateral rotator muscles of the hip (e.g., piriformis, obturator internus, gemelli, quadratus femoris) and their common action.

Iliopsoas Group:
* Identify the iliacus and psoas major muscles and describe their primary action on the hip.

**Module 3: Muscles of the Thigh Acting on the Knee and Hip**

Anterior Compartment (Thigh Extensors):
* Name the muscles of the quadriceps femoris group (rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius) and their primary action at the knee.
* What is the action of sartorius muscle?

Medial Compartment (Thigh Adductors):
* Name the major adductor muscles of the thigh (e.g., adductor longus, adductor brevis, adductor magnus, gracilis) and their primary actions.

Posterior Compartment (Thigh Flexors/Hamstrings):
* Name the hamstring muscles (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus) and their primary actions at the knee and hip.

**Module 4: Muscles of the Leg Acting on the Ankle and Foot**

Anterior Compartment (Leg Dorsiflexors):
* Name the primary dorsiflexor muscle of the ankle (tibialis anterior) and other assisting muscles (e.g., extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus).

Lateral Compartment (Leg Plantarflexors and Evertors):
* Name the fibularis (peroneus) longus and fibularis (peroneus) brevis muscles and their primary actions.

Posterior Compartment (Leg Plantarflexors):
* Name the superficial plantarflexors (gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris) and the deep plantarflexors (e.g., tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus).

**Module 5: Intrinsic Muscles of the Foot**

Organization and Function:
* Briefly describe the layers and general functions of the intrinsic muscles of the foot (support arches, movement of toes).
* Mention examples of these muscles.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance: Disorders and Function of Lower Limb Muscles**

Common Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common disorders affecting the muscles of the pelvic girdle and lower limb (e.g., strains, tears, tendinitis, compartment syndrome).

Importance in Gait and Posture:
* Emphasize the crucial role of these muscles in walking, running, and maintaining balance and posture.

Pharmacological and Clinical Therapies:
* Briefly mention relevant pharmacological and clinical therapies for disorders of these muscles.

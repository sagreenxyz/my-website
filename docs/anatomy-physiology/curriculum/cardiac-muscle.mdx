# Cardiac Muscle: The Heart's Intrinsic Contractility

**Module 1: Introduction to Cardiac Muscle**

Defining Cardiac Muscle:
* What is cardiac muscle tissue? Where is it found in the body?
* How does cardiac muscle compare to skeletal and smooth muscle in terms of structure and control?
* What is the primary function of cardiac muscle?

Organization of Cardiac Muscle:
* Describe the arrangement of cardiac muscle cells (fibers).
* What are intercalated discs, and why are they important?

**Module 2: Microscopic Anatomy of Cardiac Muscle**

Cardiac Muscle Cells:
* Describe the general structure of cardiac muscle cells (size, shape, nucleus).
* Is cardiac muscle striated? Explain why.

Sarcomeres and Myofilaments:
* Does cardiac muscle contain sarcomeres? Describe the arrangement of actin and myosin.

Sarcoplasmic Reticulum and T-Tubules in Cardiac Muscle:
* How does the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac muscle compare to that in skeletal muscle?
* Are T-tubules present in cardiac muscle?

Intercalated Discs:
* Describe the components of intercalated discs:
    * Desmosomes
    * Gap Junctions
* Explain the functional significance of gap junctions in cardiac muscle.

**Module 3: Mechanism of Cardiac Muscle Contraction**

Excitation of Cardiac Muscle:
* How is cardiac muscle excitation initiated? What is autorhythmicity?
* Describe the role of pacemaker cells in the heart.

Action Potential in Cardiac Muscle:
* Compare the action potential of a cardiac muscle cell to that of a skeletal muscle cell, noting key differences in duration and ion channels involved (e.g., slow calcium channels).

Calcium's Role in Contraction:
* Explain the sources of calcium ions that trigger cardiac muscle contraction (sarcoplasmic reticulum and extracellular calcium).
* Describe the process of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR).

The Cross-Bridge Cycle in Cardiac Muscle:
* Is the cross-bridge cycle similar to that in skeletal muscle? Explain.

**Module 4: Cardiac Muscle Physiology - Contraction and Relaxation**

The Cardiac Cycle:
* Briefly introduce the cardiac cycle (systole and diastole).

Duration of Contraction:
* How does the duration of contraction in cardiac muscle compare to skeletal muscle? Why is this difference important?

Refractory Period:
* Describe the long refractory period in cardiac muscle and its significance in preventing tetanus.

Influence of the Autonomic Nervous System:
* Explain how the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems affect heart rate and contractility.

Hormonal Influences:
* Briefly mention the effects of hormones like epinephrine on cardiac muscle.

**Module 5: Energy Metabolism of Cardiac Muscle**

Primary Energy Source:
* What is the primary source of ATP for cardiac muscle?
* Why is a constant supply of oxygen crucial for cardiac function?

Metabolic Adaptability:
* Can cardiac muscle utilize different fuel sources?

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Cardiac Muscle Disorders and Function**

Common Cardiac Muscle Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common cardiac muscle disorders (e.g., myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, heart failure).

Effects of Exercise on Cardiac Muscle:
* Discuss the adaptations of cardiac muscle to endurance training.

Pharmacological Influences on Cardiac Muscle:
* Provide examples of drugs that affect cardiac muscle function (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, cardiac glycosides).

# Central Processing in the Nervous System

**Module 1: Introduction to Neural Integration**

Defining Central Processing:
* What is central processing in the nervous system?
* Where does the majority of central processing occur?
* What are the fundamental functions of neural integration?

Basic Neural Circuits:
* Briefly introduce different types of neural circuits (e.g., converging, diverging, reverberating).

**Module 2: Processing in the Spinal Cord: Reflexes**

Spinal Reflexes:
* Define a reflex and explain the components of a reflex arc (receptor, sensory neuron, integration center, motor neuron, effector).
* Describe different types of spinal reflexes (e.g., stretch reflex, withdrawal reflex).
* What is the significance of reflexes?

Integration in Spinal Gray Matter:
* Briefly discuss the role of interneurons in the spinal cord gray matter in processing sensory information and mediating reflexes.

**Module 3: Processing in the Brainstem: Basic Life Functions and Sensory Relay**

Medulla Oblongata:
* Describe the vital reflex centers in the medulla (cardiovascular center, respiratory center).
* What other functions are integrated in the medulla?

Pons:
* Describe the nuclei in the pons that contribute to breathing control and relay information.

Midbrain:
* Briefly mention the midbrain's role in motor control, vision, and auditory processing.

Reticular Formation:
* Describe the reticular formation and its role in arousal, attention, and sleep-wake cycles.

**Module 4: Processing in the Cerebellum: Coordination and Motor Learning**

Cerebellar Structure:
* Briefly describe the main parts of the cerebellum (cerebellar cortex, white matter, deep nuclei).

Cerebellar Functions:
* Explain the role of the cerebellum in coordinating voluntary movements, posture, and balance.
* Briefly discuss the cerebellum's involvement in motor learning and cognitive functions.

**Module 5: Processing in the Diencephalon: Sensory Relay and Homeostasis**

Thalamus:
* Describe the thalamus as a major sensory relay center.
* Explain how sensory information is processed and relayed to the cerebral cortex via the thalamus.

Hypothalamus:
* Describe the hypothalamus and its role in maintaining homeostasis (e.g., body temperature, hunger, thirst, sleep-wake cycles, hormone release).
* Explain the hypothalamus's connection to the endocrine system.

Epithalamus:
* Briefly mention the pineal gland and its role in melatonin secretion and circadian rhythms.

**Module 6: Processing in the Cerebrum: Higher-Level Functions**

Cerebral Cortex:
* Describe the functional areas of the cerebral cortex (sensory areas, motor areas, association areas).
* Briefly discuss the functions associated with each lobe (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital).

Cortical Integration:
* Explain how different areas of the cerebral cortex integrate information for higher-level functions (e.g., language, memory, consciousness, thought).

Basal Nuclei:
* Describe the basal nuclei (ganglia) and their role in regulating movement and cognition.

Limbic System:
* Describe the limbic system and its involvement in emotion, memory, and motivation.

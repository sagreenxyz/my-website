# Cell Growth and Division: The Continuity of Life

**Module 1: The Cell Cycle - An Overview**

Defining the Cell Cycle:
* What is the cell cycle? Explain its importance for growth, repair, and reproduction in multicellular organisms.
* What are the two major phases of the cell cycle?
    * **Interphase:** What occurs during interphase? List and describe the three subphases ($G_1$, S, $G_2$).
    * **Mitotic (M) Phase:** What are the two main events of the M phase?

Regulation of the Cell Cycle:
* Explain the importance of cell cycle control. What are checkpoints?
* Briefly discuss the roles of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in regulating the cell cycle.

**Module 2: Interphase - Preparing for Division**

$G_1$ Phase (Gap 1) - Cell Growth and Metabolism:
* Describe the main activities that occur during the $G_1$ phase.
* What decisions are made at the $G_1$ checkpoint (restriction point)?

S Phase (Synthesis) - DNA Replication:
* Briefly review the process of DNA replication. Why is accurate DNA replication crucial before cell division?
* What is the state of the chromosomes after S phase?

$G_2$ Phase (Gap 2) - Final Preparation for Mitosis:
* Describe the main activities that occur during the $G_2$ phase.
* What is the role of the $G_2$ checkpoint?

**Module 3: Mitotic (M) Phase - Nuclear Division (Mitosis)**

Overview of Mitosis:
* What is mitosis? What is its purpose?
* Explain that mitosis results in two genetically identical daughter nuclei.
* List and describe the four main stages of mitosis:

Prophase:
* Describe the events that occur during prophase, including chromosome condensation, the formation of the mitotic spindle, and the breakdown of the nuclear envelope.

Metaphase:
* Describe the alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate. What is the role of the mitotic spindle?

Anaphase:
* Describe the separation of sister chromatids and their movement towards opposite poles of the cell.

Telophase:
* Describe the events of telophase, including chromosome decondensation, the reformation of the nuclear envelope around each set of chromosomes, and the disappearance of the mitotic spindle.

**Module 4: Cytokinesis - Division of the Cytoplasm**

Cytokinesis in Animal Cells:
* Describe the formation of the cleavage furrow and the mechanism by which the cytoplasm divides.

Cytokinesis in Plant Cells:
* Describe the formation of the cell plate and how it develops into a new cell wall, dividing the cytoplasm.

**Module 5: Cell Growth and Division in Different Contexts**

Growth and Development:
* Explain the role of cell growth and division in the development of multicellular organisms from a single fertilized egg.

Tissue Repair and Regeneration:
* Discuss how cell division contributes to the repair of damaged tissues and regeneration in some organisms.

Uncontrolled Cell Growth - Cancer:
* Explain how disruptions in cell cycle control can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of tumors.
* Briefly discuss the concepts of benign and malignant tumors and metastasis.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Targeting Cell Growth and Division**

Cancer Chemotherapy:
* Explain how many chemotherapy drugs target rapidly dividing cells, interfering with DNA replication, mitosis, or other aspects of cell division.
* Discuss the challenges and side effects associated with this approach.

Radiation Therapy:
* Briefly explain how radiation therapy damages the DNA of cancer cells, inhibiting their growth and division.

Other Therapeutic Strategies:
* Briefly mention other emerging strategies for targeting cancer cells by interfering with cell cycle regulators or signaling pathways involved in cell growth and division.

# The Integumentary System: Protection, Sensation, and More

**Module 1: Introduction to the Integumentary System**

Defining the Integumentary System:
* What are the main components of the integumentary system?
* What are the primary functions of the integumentary system?

Layers of the Skin:
* Name and describe the two main layers of the skin.
* Briefly introduce the subcutaneous layer (hypodermis) and its composition.

**Module 2: The Epidermis - The Outer Protective Layer**

Structure of the Epidermis:
* Describe the tissue type that makes up the epidermis.
* List and describe the five layers (strata) of the epidermis in thick skin, and the typical layers in thin skin, in order from deepest to most superficial.
* Identify the main cell types found in the epidermis and their functions:
    * Keratinocytes
    * Melanocytes
    * Langerhans Cells
    * Tactile (Merkel) Cells

Keratinization:
* Explain the process of keratinization and its importance in the protective function of the epidermis.

Skin Color:
* Explain the role of melanin in skin color and protection from UV radiation.
* Briefly discuss other factors that contribute to skin color (carotene, hemoglobin).

**Module 3: The Dermis - Support and Sensory Layer**

Structure of the Dermis:
* Describe the tissue type that makes up the dermis.
* Identify and describe the two layers of the dermis:
    * Papillary Layer
    * Reticular Layer
* What types of structures are found within the dermis?

Sensory Receptors of the Skin:
* Describe the different types of sensory receptors found in the dermis and epidermis and their functions:
    * Tactile (Meissner's) Corpuscles
    * Lamellar (Pacinian) Corpuscles
    * Hair Follicle Receptors
    * Free Nerve Endings
    * Tactile (Merkel) Discs
    * Ruffini Endings

**Module 4: Accessory Structures of the Skin**

Hair and Hair Follicles:
* Describe the structure of a hair and a hair follicle.
* Explain the function of the arrector pili muscle.
* Briefly discuss hair growth and the hair cycle.

Nails:
* Describe the structure of a nail.
* Explain the function of nails.

Glands of the Skin:
* Describe the structure, location, and secretions of the following glands:
    * Sudoriferous (Sweat) Glands:
        * Eccrine Sweat Glands
        * Apocrine Sweat Glands
    * Sebaceous (Oil) Glands
    * Ceruminous Glands
    * Mammary Glands (briefly)

**Module 5: Functions of the Integumentary System in Detail**

Protection:
* Explain how the skin provides protection against:
    * Mechanical Damage
    * Chemical Damage
    * Biological Damage (Pathogens)
    * UV Radiation
    * Thermal Damage
    * Dehydration

Thermoregulation:
* Describe the role of the skin in regulating body temperature through sweat glands and blood vessel dilation/constriction.

Cutaneous Sensation:
* Summarize the sensory functions of the skin through its various receptors.

Metabolic Functions:
* Explain the role of the skin in vitamin D synthesis.

Blood Reservoir:
* How does the dermis act as a blood reservoir?

Excretion:
* Briefly mention the excretory function of sweat glands.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Integumentary Disorders and Care**

Common Skin Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common skin conditions (e.g., infections, allergic reactions, eczema, psoriasis, acne).

Burns:
* Classify burns according to their severity (first, second, third degree) and describe the tissue damage involved in each.
* Discuss the systemic complications of severe burns.

Skin Cancer:
* Describe the three major types of skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma) and their characteristics.
* Discuss risk factors for skin cancer.

Aging of the Integumentary System:
* Describe the effects of aging on the skin (e.g., wrinkles, thinning, decreased elasticity).

Pharmacological Treatments for Skin Conditions:
* Provide examples of common pharmacological therapies used to treat skin disorders (e.g., topical corticosteroids, antibiotics, antifungals).

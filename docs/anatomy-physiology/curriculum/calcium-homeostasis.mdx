# Calcium Homeostasis: Maintaining Skeletal and Systemic Balance

**Module 1: Introduction to Calcium Homeostasis**

Importance of Calcium:
* Explain the vital roles of calcium in various physiological processes beyond bone structure.
* List key functions of calcium (e.g., nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, blood clotting, enzyme cofactor).
* What is the normal range of calcium levels in the blood? Why is maintaining this range critical?

Calcium Distribution in the Body:
* Describe the distribution of calcium in the body (bone, intracellular fluid, extracellular fluid/blood).
* Explain that bone serves as a major reservoir for calcium.

**Module 2: Hormonal Control of Blood Calcium Levels**

Parathyroid Hormone (PTH):
* Identify the gland that secretes PTH.
* Describe the stimuli that trigger PTH release (low blood calcium levels).
* Explain the three main target organs of PTH and its effects on each to increase blood calcium:
    * Bone: Osteoclast activity and calcium release.
    * Kidneys: Increased calcium reabsorption and activation of vitamin D.
    * Intestines (indirectly): Increased calcium absorption via activated vitamin D.

Vitamin D (Calcitriol):
* Explain how vitamin D is synthesized (including skin, liver, and kidney activation) or obtained through diet.
* Describe the stimuli that promote vitamin D activation (PTH, low blood phosphate).
* Explain the primary target organ of active vitamin D and its effect on blood calcium levels (increased intestinal absorption).
* Discuss the role of vitamin D in bone health.

Calcitonin:
* Identify the gland that secretes calcitonin.
* Describe the stimuli that trigger calcitonin release (high blood calcium levels).
* Explain the main target organ of calcitonin and its effect on blood calcium levels (inhibits osteoclast activity and increases calcium deposition in bone).
* Discuss the relative importance of calcitonin in calcium homeostasis.

**Module 3: Other Factors Influencing Calcium Balance**

Dietary Intake:
* Explain the importance of adequate dietary calcium for maintaining calcium homeostasis.

Calcium Excretion:
* Describe the routes of calcium excretion from the body (primarily kidneys and feces).
* How do the kidneys regulate calcium excretion?

Phosphate Homeostasis:
* Briefly discuss the reciprocal relationship between calcium and phosphate regulation.

**Module 4: Imbalances of Calcium Homeostasis**

Hypercalcemia:
* Define hypercalcemia and list potential causes (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, certain cancers, excessive vitamin D intake).
* Describe the potential signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia.

Hypocalcemia:
* Define hypocalcemia and list potential causes (e.g., hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, kidney disease).
* Describe the potential signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia.

**Module 5: Clinical Assessment of Calcium Homeostasis**

Blood Calcium Tests:
* Explain how blood tests are used to measure total and ionized calcium levels.

PTH and Vitamin D Levels:
* Discuss the clinical significance of measuring PTH and vitamin D levels in evaluating calcium imbalances.

Bone Density Scans (DEXA):
* Explain how bone mineral density is assessed and its relationship to long-term calcium balance.

**Module 6: Clinical Management of Calcium Imbalances**

Treatment of Hypercalcemia:
* Discuss various treatment strategies for hypercalcemia (e.g., hydration, medications to reduce bone resorption or calcium absorption).

Treatment of Hypocalcemia:
* Discuss various treatment strategies for hypocalcemia (e.g., calcium supplementation, vitamin D therapy).

Pharmacological Agents Affecting Calcium Homeostasis:
* Provide examples of medications that influence calcium levels (e.g., bisphosphonates, calcium supplements, vitamin D analogs).

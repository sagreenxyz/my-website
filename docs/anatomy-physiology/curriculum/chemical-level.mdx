# Chemical Level of Organization

**Module 1: Fundamental Building Blocks**

Matter and Elements:
* What is matter? What are its fundamental properties?
* Define an element. How many naturally occurring elements are there?
* Identify the four most abundant elements in the human body by mass and by the number of atoms.

Atoms: The Smallest Units:
* What is an atom? Describe its basic structure, including subatomic particles (protons, neutrons, electrons), the nucleus, and electron shells.
* Explain the significance of the number of protons in an atom. What is the atomic number?
* What are isotopes? How do they differ from each other?

**Module 2: Forming Molecules: Chemical Bonds**

Molecules and Compounds:
* What is a molecule? How is it formed?
* What is the difference between a molecule and a compound? Provide examples.

Types of Chemical Bonds:
* Describe the following types of chemical bonds, explaining how they occur and their relative strengths:
    * Ionic bonds
    * Covalent bonds (polar and nonpolar)
    * Hydrogen bonds
* Explain the importance of hydrogen bonds in biological systems, particularly in water and DNA.

**Module 3: Key Inorganic Molecules in the Body**

Water: The Solvent of Life:
* Describe the structure of a water molecule and its polar nature.
* Explain the key properties of water that make it essential for life (e.g., high heat capacity, high heat of vaporization, polarity as a solvent, reactivity, cushioning).

Acids, Bases, and Salts:
* Define acids and bases in terms of hydrogen ion (H+) and hydroxide ion (OH-) concentration.
* Explain the pH scale and its significance in biological systems. What is a neutral pH? Acidic? Basic/alkaline?
* What are salts? How are they formed? Provide examples of important salts in the body (e.g., electrolytes).
* What are buffers? How do they help maintain pH homeostasis in the body?

**Module 4: Essential Organic Molecules: The Building Blocks of Life**

Introduction to Organic Molecules:
* What makes a molecule "organic"? What is the primary element found in organic molecules?
* List the four major classes of organic molecules essential to human life.

Carbohydrates: Energy and Structure:
* Describe the basic structure and functions of carbohydrates.
* Distinguish between monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. Provide examples of each and their roles in the body (e.g., glucose, sucrose, glycogen).

Lipids: Fats, Oils, and Steroids:
* Describe the general characteristics and functions of lipids.
* Compare and contrast triglycerides (fats and oils), phospholipids, and steroids. Explain their importance in the body (e.g., energy storage, cell membranes, hormones).

Proteins: Diverse Functions:
* Describe the basic structure of proteins, including amino acids and peptide bonds.
* Explain the different levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary) and how they relate to protein function.
* List and describe the various functions of proteins in the body (e.g., enzymes, structural components, hormones, antibodies, transport).

Nucleic Acids: Information Storage and Transfer:
* Describe the basic structure of nucleic acids, including nucleotides.
* Compare and contrast the structures and functions of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). Explain their roles in genetic information and protein synthesis.

**Module 5: Clinical Relevance: Chemical Imbalances**

Chemical Imbalances and Disease:
* Explain how imbalances in the chemical composition of the body can lead to various diseases and conditions. Provide specific examples related to:
    * Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., sodium, potassium)
    * Acid-base imbalances (acidosis, alkalosis)
    * Blood glucose levels (diabetes)
    * Cholesterol levels (cardiovascular disease)

Pharmacological Interventions Targeting the Chemical Level:
* Discuss how many pharmacological therapies work by interacting with molecules at the chemical level in the body. Provide examples of drugs that target:
    * Enzymes (e.g., enzyme inhibitors)
    * Receptors (e.g., agonists, antagonists)
    * Ion channels (e.g., channel blockers)
* Explain the importance of understanding the chemical structures and interactions of drugs and biological molecules in pharmacology.

# The Axial Skeleton: The Body's Central Framework

**Module 1: Introduction to the Axial Skeleton**

Defining the Axial Skeleton:
* What are the components of the axial skeleton?
* What are the primary functions of the axial skeleton?

Organization of the Axial Skeleton:
* List the three major regions of the axial skeleton.

**Module 2: The Skull - Protecting the Brain and Sensory Organs**

Cranial Bones:
* Name the eight cranial bones and describe their locations and major features:
    * Frontal Bone
    * Parietal Bones (paired)
    * Temporal Bones (paired)
    * Occipital Bone
    * Sphenoid Bone
    * Ethmoid Bone

Facial Bones:
* Name the fourteen facial bones and describe their locations and major features:
    * Mandible
    * Maxillae (paired)
    * Zygomatic Bones (paired)
    * Nasal Bones (paired)
    * Lacrimal Bones (paired)
    * Palatine Bones (paired)
    * Inferior Nasal Conchae (paired)
    * Vomer

Special Features of the Skull:
* Describe the sutures of the skull and their significance.
* Identify and describe the major foramina (openings) of the skull and the structures that pass through them.
* Describe the paranasal sinuses and their functions.
* Briefly describe the hyoid bone and its unique characteristics.

**Module 3: The Vertebral Column (Spine) - Support and Protection of the Spinal Cord**

General Structure of the Vertebral Column:
* Describe the number of vertebrae in each region (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, coccygeal).
* Describe the curvatures of the vertebral column and their developmental origins.

Structure of a Typical Vertebra:
* Identify and describe the key components of a typical vertebra (body, vertebral arch, pedicles, laminae, spinous process, transverse processes, vertebral foramen, intervertebral foramina).

Regional Characteristics of Vertebrae:
* Describe the unique features of vertebrae in each region (cervical, thoracic, lumbar).
* Describe the sacrum and coccyx.

Intervertebral Discs:
* Describe the structure and function of intervertebral discs.

**Module 4: The Thoracic Cage - Protecting the Heart and Lungs**

Components of the Thoracic Cage:
* List the three main components of the thoracic cage.

Ribs:
* Classify the ribs (true, false, floating) and describe their attachments.

Sternum:
* Describe the three parts of the sternum (manubrium, body, xiphoid process).

Thoracic Vertebrae:
* Briefly review the characteristics of thoracic vertebrae.

Functions of the Thoracic Cage:
* Describe the protective functions of the thoracic cage.
* Explain its role in breathing.

**Module 5: Clinical Relevance - Disorders of the Axial Skeleton**

Skull Fractures:
* Briefly discuss different types of skull fractures and their potential complications.

Vertebral Column Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of vertebral column disorders (e.g., herniated discs, scoliosis, kyphosis, lordosis, spinal stenosis).

Thoracic Cage Injuries and Deformities:
* Briefly discuss rib fractures and deformities of the thoracic cage.

Pharmacological and Clinical Therapies:
* Briefly mention relevant pharmacological and clinical therapies for disorders of the axial skeleton.

**Module 6: Aging of the Axial Skeleton**

Effects of Aging:
* Describe the typical effects of aging on the bones of the axial skeleton, the vertebral column, and joints.

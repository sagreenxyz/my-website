# The Thyroid Gland: Regulating Metabolism and Calcium Levels

**Module 1: Introduction to the Thyroid Gland**

Defining the Thyroid Gland:
* Describe the location and gross anatomy of the thyroid gland.
* What are the two main types of hormones produced by the thyroid gland?

**Module 2: Thyroid Hormones - T3 and T4**

Synthesis of Thyroid Hormones:
* Describe the process of thyroid hormone synthesis, including the roles of iodine, thyroglobulin, and thyroid peroxidase.
* Explain the difference between T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine). Which is more active?

Transport and Activation:
* How are thyroid hormones transported in the blood?
* Explain the conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues.

Mechanism of Action:
* Describe the intracellular mechanism of action of thyroid hormones.

Physiological Effects:
* Discuss the major effects of thyroid hormones on:
    * Metabolism (basal metabolic rate, thermogenesis)
    * Growth and development
    * Cardiovascular system
    * Nervous system
    * Musculoskeletal system

Regulation of Thyroid Hormone Release:
* Explain the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (TRH, TSH).
* Describe the negative feedback loop regulating thyroid hormone levels.

**Module 3: Calcitonin - Regulating Calcium Levels**

Synthesis and Release:
* Which cells in the thyroid gland produce calcitonin?
* What stimulates the release of calcitonin?

Mechanism of Action:
* Describe the primary target organ and effects of calcitonin on blood calcium levels.

Physiological Role:
* Discuss the importance of calcitonin in calcium homeostasis, particularly in comparison to parathyroid hormone.

**Module 4: Clinical Relevance - Thyroid Disorders - Hypothyroidism**

Causes of Hypothyroidism:
* Describe common causes of hypothyroidism (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis, iodine deficiency, thyroidectomy).

Signs and Symptoms:
* List and explain the common signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
* Briefly mention how hypothyroidism is diagnosed and treated (e.g., thyroid hormone replacement).

**Module 5: Clinical Relevance - Thyroid Disorders - Hyperthyroidism**

Causes of Hyperthyroidism:
* Describe common causes of hyperthyroidism (e.g., Graves' disease, toxic nodular goiter).

Signs and Symptoms:
* List and explain the common signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
* Briefly mention how hyperthyroidism is diagnosed and treated (e.g., medications, radioactive iodine, surgery).

**Module 6: Pharmacology Targeting the Thyroid Gland**

Drugs for Hypothyroidism:
* Provide examples of thyroid hormone replacement medications (e.g., levothyroxine).

Drugs for Hyperthyroidism:
* Provide examples of drugs used to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis or release (e.g., methimazole, propylthiouracil).
* Briefly mention other treatments like beta-blockers for symptomatic relief.

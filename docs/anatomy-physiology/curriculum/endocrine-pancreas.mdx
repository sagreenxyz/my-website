# The Endocrine Pancreas: Regulating Blood Glucose

**Module 1: Introduction to the Endocrine Pancreas**

Defining the Endocrine Pancreas:
* Describe the location of the pancreas and its dual function (exocrine and endocrine).
* Identify the endocrine cells of the pancreas and their arrangement (islets of Langerhans).
* What are the two main types of endocrine cells in the islets and the hormones they produce?

**Module 2: Insulin - Lowering Blood Glucose**

Synthesis and Release of Insulin:
* Describe the beta (β) cells of the islets and their role in insulin synthesis and secretion.
* What is the primary stimulus for insulin release?
* What other factors influence insulin secretion?

Target Organs of Insulin:
* Identify the major target organs of insulin.

Effects of Insulin on Target Cells:
* Explain how insulin lowers blood glucose levels by:
    * Facilitating glucose uptake into cells.
    * Stimulating glycogenesis (glycogen formation).
    * Inhibiting glycogenolysis (glycogen breakdown).
    * Inhibiting gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis from non-carbohydrates).
    * Promoting glucose use for ATP production.
    * Promoting fat and protein synthesis.

**Module 3: Glucagon - Raising Blood Glucose**

Synthesis and Release of Glucagon:
* Describe the alpha (α) cells of the islets and their role in glucagon synthesis and secretion.
* What is the primary stimulus for glucagon release?
* What other factors influence glucagon secretion?

Target Organ of Glucagon:
* Identify the primary target organ of glucagon (liver).

Effects of Glucagon on the Liver:
* Explain how glucagon raises blood glucose levels by:
    * Stimulating glycogenolysis.
    * Stimulating gluconeogenesis.
    * Inhibiting glycogenesis.

**Module 4: Regulation of Blood Glucose**

The Role of Insulin and Glucagon:
* Explain the antagonistic relationship between insulin and glucagon in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis.
* Describe the feedback loops involving blood glucose levels and the secretion of these two hormones.

Other Hormones Affecting Blood Glucose:
* Briefly mention other hormones that can influence blood glucose levels (e.g., cortisol, epinephrine, growth hormone).

**Module 5: Clinical Relevance - Disorders of the Endocrine Pancreas - Diabetes Mellitus**

Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus:
* Describe the pathophysiology of Type 1 diabetes (autoimmune destruction of beta cells, insulin deficiency).
* List the classic symptoms of hyperglycemia.
* Briefly discuss treatment strategies (insulin therapy).

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:
* Describe the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency).
* List risk factors for Type 2 diabetes.
* Briefly discuss treatment strategies (lifestyle modifications, oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin).

Gestational Diabetes:
* Briefly describe gestational diabetes and its implications.

**Module 6: Pharmacology Targeting the Endocrine Pancreas**

Insulin Preparations:
* Provide examples of different types of insulin used in diabetes treatment (e.g., rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, long-acting).

Oral Hypoglycemic Agents:
* Briefly mention different classes of oral medications used to manage Type 2 diabetes and their mechanisms of action (e.g., sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors).

Glucagon Therapy:
* Explain the use of glucagon in treating severe hypoglycemia.

# X-Linked Inheritance

**Module 1: Introduction to X-Linked Inheritance**

Defining X-Linked Inheritance:
* What does "X-linked" mean in the context of inheritance?
* Explain why the inheritance pattern of genes located on the X chromosome differs between males and females.

Hemizygosity in Males:
* Explain the concept of hemizygosity in males for X-linked genes. Why do males only have one allele for these genes?

Key Characteristics:
* List the key characteristics that often indicate an X-linked pattern of inheritance in pedigrees.

**Module 2: X-Linked Recessive Inheritance**

Genotypes and Phenotypes:
* Explain the possible genotypes and phenotypes for X-linked recessive traits in males ($X^RY, X^rY$) and females ($X^RX^R, X^RX^r, X^rX^r$).
* Which genotypes will express the recessive phenotype in males and females?
* Which genotype makes a female a carrier?

Pedigree Analysis:
* Explain how to recognize an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern in a pedigree.
* What are some typical features to look for (e.g., affected males often have unaffected mothers who are carriers, trait skips generations, no father-to-son transmission)?
* Analyze a sample pedigree illustrating X-linked recessive inheritance.

Examples of X-Linked Recessive Disorders:
* Hemophilia: Briefly describe hemophilia and its inheritance pattern.
* Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD): Briefly describe DMD and its inheritance pattern.
* Color Blindness (red-green): Briefly describe color blindness and its inheritance pattern.

**Module 3: X-Linked Dominant Inheritance**

Genotypes and Phenotypes:
* Explain the possible genotypes and phenotypes for X-linked dominant traits in males ($X^DY, X^dY$) and females ($X^DX^D, X^DX^d, X^dX^d$).
* Which genotypes will express the dominant phenotype in males and females?

Pedigree Analysis:
* Explain how to recognize an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern in a pedigree.
* What are some typical features to look for (e.g., affected males pass the trait to all their daughters but none of their sons, affected heterozygous females pass the trait to half their sons and half their daughters)?
* Analyze a sample pedigree illustrating X-linked dominant inheritance.

Examples of X-Linked Dominant Disorders:
* Hypophosphatemic Rickets (Vitamin D-Resistant Rickets): Briefly describe this condition and its inheritance pattern.
* Rett Syndrome: Briefly describe Rett Syndrome and its inheritance pattern (often lethal in males).

**Module 4: Comparison of X-Linked Recessive and Dominant Inheritance**

Key Differences in Pedigree Patterns:
* Summarize the key distinguishing features in pedigrees that help differentiate between X-linked recessive and X-linked dominant inheritance.

Transmission from Affected Males:
* Compare the transmission of the trait from an affected father to his sons and daughters in both patterns.

Transmission from Affected Heterozygous Females:
* Compare the transmission of the trait from an affected heterozygous mother to her sons and daughters in both patterns.

**Module 5: Clinical Relevance: X-Linked Disorders**

Diagnosis and Genetic Testing:
* Briefly discuss how X-linked disorders are diagnosed, including the role of genetic testing.

Genetic Counseling:
* Explain the importance of genetic counseling for individuals and families affected by or at risk for X-linked disorders, including risk assessment for offspring.

Carrier Testing:
* Explain the role of carrier testing for females in X-linked recessive disorders.

Management and Treatment:
* Briefly mention the general approaches to managing X-linked disorders.

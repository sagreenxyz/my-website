# The Heart: The Central Pump of the Cardiovascular System

**Module 1: Introduction to the Heart**

Defining the Heart:
* What is the heart? What is its primary function?
* Where is the heart located within the thoracic cavity?
* Briefly describe the size and shape of the heart.

Overview of the Cardiovascular System:
* Briefly explain the role of the heart within the broader cardiovascular system.

**Module 2: Gross Anatomy of the Heart**

Pericardium:
* Describe the structure and function of the pericardium (fibrous and serous).

Heart Wall:
* Describe the three layers of the heart wall (epicardium, myocardium, endocardium).

Chambers of the Heart:
* Identify and describe the four chambers of the heart (right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle).

Valves of the Heart:
* Name and describe the four valves of the heart (atrioventricular: tricuspid and mitral; semilunar: pulmonary and aortic) and their functions in ensuring unidirectional blood flow.

Major Blood Vessels Connected to the Heart:
* Identify the major blood vessels entering and leaving each chamber of the heart (vena cavae, pulmonary trunk, pulmonary veins, aorta).

**Module 3: Microscopic Anatomy of the Heart**

Cardiac Muscle Tissue:
* Briefly review the structure and function of cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes), including striations, intercalated discs, and gap junctions.

Connective Tissue Skeleton:
* Describe the fibrous skeleton of the heart and its functions.

**Module 4: Blood Flow Through the Heart**

Pulmonary Circulation:
* Trace the flow of deoxygenated blood from the body to the right atrium, through the right ventricle, and to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries.

Systemic Circulation:
* Trace the flow of oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium, through the left ventricle, and out to the body via the aorta.

Coronary Circulation:
* Describe the blood supply to the heart muscle itself via the coronary arteries and venous drainage.

**Module 5: The Cardiac Cycle - Events of the Heartbeat**

Phases of the Cardiac Cycle:
* Describe the key phases of the cardiac cycle (systole and diastole).
* Detail the events occurring in the atria and ventricles during each phase (filling, contraction, ejection, relaxation).

Heart Sounds:
* Explain the origin of the normal heart sounds (S1 and S2).

Regulation of Heart Rate and Contractility:
* Briefly introduce the intrinsic regulation of heart rate (pacemaker cells).
* Briefly introduce the extrinsic regulation by the autonomic nervous system and hormones.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Heart Disorders and Function**

Common Cardiovascular Diseases:
* Briefly describe examples of common heart disorders (e.g., coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, valve disorders, arrhythmias).

Diagnostic Procedures:
* Briefly mention common diagnostic procedures used to assess heart function (e.g., ECG, echocardiogram).

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Provide examples of drugs used to treat heart conditions (e.g., anti-anginals, antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics).

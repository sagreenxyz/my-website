# Bone Tissue: Structure, Function, and Remodeling

**Module 1: Introduction to Bone Tissue**

Defining Bone Tissue:
* What is bone tissue (osseous tissue)? What is its primary function?
* What are the other important functions of bone tissue?
* What are the two main macroscopic types of bone tissue?

**Module 2: Microscopic Structure of Bone Tissue**

Bone Cells:
* Describe the four main types of bone cells and their functions:
    * Osteoblasts
    * Osteocytes
    * Osteoclasts
    * Osteogenic Cells

Extracellular Matrix:
* Describe the organic components of the bone matrix (osteoid, collagen fibers). What properties do they provide?
* Describe the inorganic components of the bone matrix (hydroxyapatites). What properties do they provide?

Compact Bone:
* Describe the structural unit of compact bone, the osteon (Haversian system).
* Identify and describe the components of an osteon (Haversian canal, lamellae, osteocytes in lacunae, canaliculi, Volkmann's canals).

Spongy Bone:
* Describe the structure of spongy bone (trabeculae, osteocytes in lacunae, canaliculi).
* How does spongy bone differ from compact bone in its organization?

**Module 3: Macroscopic Structure of Bones**

Long Bones:
* Describe the gross anatomy of a long bone (diaphysis, epiphyses, metaphyses, periosteum, endosteum, articular cartilage, medullary cavity).

Short, Flat, and Irregular Bones:
* Briefly describe the general structure of these bone types.

Bone Markings:
* Define bone markings and explain their significance.
* Provide examples of different types of bone markings (e.g., projections, depressions, openings).

**Module 4: Bone Development and Growth (Ossification)**

Intramembranous Ossification:
* Describe the process of intramembranous ossification. Which bones develop this way?

Endochondral Ossification:
* Describe the process of endochondral ossification. Which bones develop this way?
* Explain the role of the epiphyseal plate in long bone growth.
* Describe the zones of the epiphyseal plate.
* How does long bone growth end?

Bone Remodeling:
* What is bone remodeling? What are the roles of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in this process?
* Why is bone remodeling important?

**Module 5: Bone Homeostasis - Calcium Regulation**

Importance of Calcium:
* Explain the vital roles of calcium in the body.

Hormonal Control of Calcium:
* Describe the roles of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin in regulating blood calcium levels and their effects on bone tissue.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Bone Disorders and Function**

Common Bone Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common bone disorders (e.g., fractures, osteoporosis, osteomalacia/rickets, Paget's disease).

Bone Repair:
* Describe the stages of fracture repair.

Pharmacological Influences on Bone Tissue:
* Provide examples of drugs that affect bone tissue (e.g., bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy).

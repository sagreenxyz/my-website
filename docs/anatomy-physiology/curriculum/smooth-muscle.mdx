# Smooth Muscle: Involuntary Actions and Diverse Functions

**Module 1: Introduction to Smooth Muscle**

Defining Smooth Muscle:
* What is smooth muscle tissue? Where is it found in the body?
* How does smooth muscle compare to skeletal and cardiac muscle in terms of structure, control, and contraction?
* What are the key functions of smooth muscle in various organ systems?

Organization of Smooth Muscle:
* Describe the arrangement of smooth muscle cells. Are they striated?
* What are the two main types of smooth muscle based on organization and innervation?

**Module 2: Microscopic Anatomy of Smooth Muscle**

Smooth Muscle Cells:
* Describe the general structure of smooth muscle cells (size, shape, nucleus).
* Explain the arrangement of actin and myosin filaments. What are dense bodies and dense bands?
* Does smooth muscle have sarcomeres?

Sarcoplasmic Reticulum and T-Tubules in Smooth Muscle:
* How does the sarcoplasmic reticulum in smooth muscle compare to that in skeletal and cardiac muscle?
* Are T-tubules present in smooth muscle?

**Module 3: Mechanism of Smooth Muscle Contraction**

Excitation of Smooth Muscle:
* How is smooth muscle excitation initiated? Discuss neural, hormonal, and local chemical stimuli.
* Explain the role of neurotransmitters and hormones in smooth muscle contraction.

Calcium's Role in Contraction:
* What are the sources of calcium ions that trigger smooth muscle contraction (sarcoplasmic reticulum and extracellular calcium)?
* Describe the calcium-calmodulin pathway in smooth muscle contraction.

The Cross-Bridge Cycle in Smooth Muscle:
* How does the cross-bridge cycle in smooth muscle differ from that in skeletal muscle? Explain the role of myosin light chain kinase and myosin light chain phosphatase.

The Latch Mechanism:
* Explain the latch mechanism in smooth muscle and its significance in maintaining prolonged contractions with minimal ATP use.

**Module 4: Smooth Muscle Physiology - Contraction Patterns and Regulation**

Contraction Characteristics:
* How does the speed of contraction in smooth muscle compare to skeletal and cardiac muscle?
* Explain the sustained nature of smooth muscle contractions (tone).

Regulation of Contraction:
* Discuss the influence of the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic) on smooth muscle activity.
* Describe the effects of various hormones (e.g., epinephrine, oxytocin, angiotensin II) on smooth muscle.
* Explain how local chemical factors (e.g., pH, oxygen levels, carbon dioxide levels) can regulate smooth muscle contraction.

Types of Smooth Muscle:
* Compare and contrast single-unit (visceral) and multi-unit smooth muscle in terms of:
    * Cell arrangement
    * Innervation
    * Intercellular communication (gap junctions)
    * Contraction patterns
    * Examples in the body

**Module 5: Energy Metabolism of Smooth Muscle**

Primary Energy Source:
* What are the primary sources of ATP for smooth muscle contraction?
* Is smooth muscle primarily aerobic or anaerobic?

Metabolic Characteristics:
* How does the energy consumption of smooth muscle compare to skeletal muscle?

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Smooth Muscle Disorders and Function**

Common Smooth Muscle Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common smooth muscle disorders affecting various organ systems (e.g., asthma, hypertension, irritable bowel syndrome, preterm labor).

Pharmacological Influences on Smooth Muscle:
* Provide examples of drugs that affect smooth muscle function (e.g., bronchodilators, vasoconstrictors, antispasmodics, tocolytics).

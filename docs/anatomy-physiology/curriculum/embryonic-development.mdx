# Embryonic Development: The Foundation of Human Form

**Module 1: Early Embryonic Development - Cleavage and Blastocyst Formation**

Fertilization (Review):
* Briefly recap fertilization and zygote formation.

Cleavage:
* Describe the process of cleavage: rapid mitotic cell divisions without significant cell growth.
* What are blastomeres?
* Describe the formation of the morula.

Blastocyst Formation:
* Describe the structure of the blastocyst (trophoblast, inner cell mass, blastocoel).
* What are the fates of the trophoblast and inner cell mass?

Implantation:
* Describe the process of blastocyst implantation in the uterine wall.

**Module 2: Gastrulation - The Formation of Germ Layers**

The Process of Gastrulation:
* What is gastrulation?
* Explain the movement of cells during gastrulation.

Formation of the Germ Layers:
* Describe the three primary germ layers formed during gastrulation:
    * Ectoderm: What tissues will it give rise to?
    * Mesoderm: What tissues will it give rise to?
    * Endoderm: What tissues will it give rise to?

The Primitive Streak:
* Describe the formation and significance of the primitive streak.

**Module 3: Neurulation - The Formation of the Nervous System**

Neural Plate and Neural Folds:
* Describe the formation of the neural plate from the ectoderm.
* Explain the elevation of the neural folds.

Neural Tube Formation:
* Describe the fusion of the neural folds to form the neural tube.
* What structures does the neural tube give rise to?
* What are the neural crest cells and their derivatives?

**Module 4: Organogenesis - The Formation of Organs**

General Principles of Organogenesis:
* Explain that organogenesis involves the differentiation and interaction of the three germ layers.
* What is induction in development?

Development of Specific Systems (Brief Overview):
* Briefly outline the initial development of the cardiovascular system, digestive system, respiratory system, and urogenital system during the embryonic period.

**Module 5: Fetal Development - Growth and Maturation**

Transition from Embryo to Fetus:
* When does the embryonic period end and the fetal period begin?

Growth and Differentiation:
* Describe the continued growth and differentiation of organs and tissues during the fetal period.

Placental Function:
* Briefly review the role of the placenta in providing nutrients and oxygen and removing wastes.

**Module 6: Factors Influencing Embryonic Development**

Genetic Factors:
* Explain the role of genes in directing embryonic development.
* Briefly mention the impact of genetic mutations.

Environmental Factors:
* What are teratogens? Provide examples of environmental factors that can harm embryonic development.
* Discuss critical periods of development.

**Module 7: Clinical Relevance - Developmental Abnormalities**

Congenital Malformations:
* What are congenital malformations?
* Briefly discuss examples of common congenital abnormalities and their potential developmental origins.

Impact on Health:
* Explain the significance of understanding embryonic development in the context of human health and disease.

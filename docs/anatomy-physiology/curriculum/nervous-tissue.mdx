# Nervous Tissue: Communication and Control

**Module 1: Introduction to Nervous Tissue**

Defining Nervous Tissue:
* What is nervous tissue? What is its primary function?
* What are the two main cell types found in nervous tissue?

Overview of Nervous System Functions:
* Briefly describe the major functions of the nervous system:
    * Sensory Input
    * Integration
    * Motor Output

**Module 2: Neurons - The Conducting Cells**

Structure of a Neuron:
* Describe the key structural components of a neuron:
    * Cell Body (Soma)
    * Dendrites
    * Axon
    * Axon Hillock
    * Axon Terminals (Synaptic Knobs)
    * Myelin Sheath (and Nodes of Ranvier)

Functional Classification of Neurons:
* Describe the three functional classifications of neurons based on the direction of nerve impulse relative to the central nervous system (CNS):
    * Sensory (Afferent) Neurons
    * Motor (Efferent) Neurons
    * Interneurons (Association Neurons)

Structural Classification of Neurons:
* Describe the structural classifications of neurons based on the number of processes extending from the cell body:
    * Multipolar Neurons
    * Bipolar Neurons
    * Unipolar (Pseudounipolar) Neurons

**Module 3: Neuroglia (Glial Cells) - Supporting the Neurons**

Neuroglia of the Central Nervous System (CNS):
* Describe the structure and functions of the following glial cells in the CNS:
    * Astrocytes
    * Microglial Cells
    * Ependymal Cells
    * Oligodendrocytes

Neuroglia of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):
* Describe the structure and functions of the following glial cells in the PNS:
    * Satellite Cells
    * Schwann Cells

**Module 4: Nerve Impulse - Action Potential**

Resting Membrane Potential:
* Explain the concept of the resting membrane potential. What are the main factors contributing to it (ion concentrations, permeability, sodium-potassium pump)?

Graded Potentials:
* What are graded potentials? How do they differ from action potentials in terms of strength and distance traveled?
* Describe the types of graded potentials (depolarizing and hyperpolarizing).

Action Potential:
* Describe the sequence of events during an action potential:
    * Depolarization to Threshold
    * Rapid Depolarization (Sodium Influx)
    * Repolarization (Potassium Efflux)
    * Hyperpolarization
* Explain the all-or-none principle of action potentials.
* What is the refractory period and its significance?

Propagation of Action Potentials:
* Explain how action potentials are propagated along an unmyelinated axon.
* Explain how myelination increases the speed of action potential propagation (saltatory conduction).

**Module 5: Synaptic Transmission - Communication Between Neurons**

Structure of a Synapse:
* Describe the components of a synapse (presynaptic neuron, synaptic cleft, postsynaptic neuron).

Chemical Synapses:
* Explain the process of synaptic transmission at a chemical synapse:
    * Neurotransmitter Release (calcium influx)
    * Neurotransmitter Binding to Postsynaptic Receptors
    * Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs)
    * Neurotransmitter Removal

Electrical Synapses:
* Briefly describe electrical synapses and how they differ from chemical synapses.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Nervous Tissue Disorders and Function**

Common Neurological Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common neurological disorders affecting nervous tissue (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, neuropathies).

Impact of Glial Cell Dysfunction:
* Discuss how dysfunction of different types of glial cells can contribute to neurological disorders.

Pharmacological Interventions in the Nervous System:
* Provide examples of drugs that affect nervous tissue function by influencing neurotransmitter levels, receptors, or ion channels.

# The Central Nervous System (CNS): The Body's Command Center

**Module 1: Introduction to the Central Nervous System**

Defining the CNS:
* What are the two main components of the central nervous system (CNS)?
* What are the primary functions of the CNS?

Organization of the CNS:
* Briefly outline the major regions of the brain and the spinal cord.

**Module 2: The Brain - The Seat of Higher Functions**

Major Regions of the Brain:
* Describe the four principal parts of the brain:
    * Cerebrum: Cerebral hemispheres, cerebral cortex (lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital), white matter, basal nuclei.
    * Diencephalon: Thalamus, hypothalamus, epithalamus.
    * Brainstem: Midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata.
    * Cerebellum.

Functions of Brain Regions:
* Briefly describe the main functions associated with each major brain region and specific structures within them (e.g., frontal lobe - executive functions, cerebellum - coordination, hypothalamus - homeostasis).

**Module 3: The Spinal Cord - The Information Highway**

Structure of the Spinal Cord:
* Describe the gross anatomy of the spinal cord: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal regions; anterior and posterior gray horns; anterior, posterior, and lateral white columns; central canal.

Functions of the Spinal Cord:
* Explain the two primary functions of the spinal cord:
    * Conduction Pathway: Ascending (sensory) tracts and descending (motor) tracts.
    * Reflex Center: Spinal reflexes.

**Module 4: Protection of the Central Nervous System**

Bony Protection:
* Describe how the skull protects the brain and the vertebral column protects the spinal cord.

Meninges:
* Describe the three layers of the meninges (dura mater, arachnoid mater, pia mater) and their functions.
* What are the subdural and subarachnoid spaces?

Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):
* Explain where CSF is produced (choroid plexuses).
* Describe the circulation of CSF.
* What are the functions of CSF (cushioning, nutrient/waste transport)?

Blood-Brain Barrier:
* Describe the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier.
* What types of substances can and cannot cross the blood-brain barrier?

**Module 5: Neural Pathways in the CNS**

Sensory Pathways:
* Describe the general organization of ascending pathways (first-order, second-order, third-order neurons).
* Briefly outline the major sensory pathways (e.g., dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, spinothalamic pathway).

Motor Pathways:
* Describe the general organization of descending pathways (upper and lower motor neurons).
* Briefly outline the major motor pathways (e.g., direct/pyramidal pathways, indirect/extrapyramidal pathways).

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - CNS Disorders and Function**

Common Neurological Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common neurological disorders affecting the CNS (e.g., stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, meningitis).

Diagnostic Imaging:
* Briefly mention the use of medical imaging techniques (e.g., MRI, CT scans) to visualize CNS structures and identify abnormalities.

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Briefly discuss how drugs target specific structures and pathways within the CNS to treat neurological conditions.

**Module 1: Introduction to Nutrition**

Defining Nutrition:
* What is nutrition?
* What are the essential nutrients?
* Differentiate between macronutrients and micronutrients.

The Importance of Nutrition:
* Discuss the role of nutrition in providing energy, building and repairing tissues, and regulating body processes.
* Explain the concept of a balanced diet.

Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs):
* Briefly introduce DRIs and their purpose (recommended intake levels for various nutrients).

**Module 2: Macronutrients - The Energy Providers**

Carbohydrates:
* Describe the different types of carbohydrates (simple and complex).
* Explain their digestion and absorption.
* Discuss their primary role as an energy source.
* What are the recommended intakes of carbohydrates?

Lipids (Fats):
* Describe the different types of lipids (triglycerides, phospholipids, sterols).
* Explain their digestion and absorption.
* Discuss their roles in energy storage, insulation, and hormone synthesis.
* What are the essential fatty acids?
* What are the recommended intakes of lipids?

Proteins:
* Describe the structure of proteins (amino acids).
* Explain their digestion and absorption.
* Discuss their roles in building and repairing tissues, enzyme function, and hormone synthesis.
* What are essential amino acids?
* What are the recommended intakes of proteins?

**Module 3: Micronutrients - Essential for Function**

Vitamins:
* Define vitamins and their general functions.
* Differentiate between water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins.
* Briefly discuss the roles and sources of key vitamins.

Minerals:
* Define minerals and their general functions.
* Briefly discuss the roles and sources of key minerals (e.g., calcium, iron, potassium, sodium).

Water:
* Explain the importance of water as an essential nutrient and its various roles in the body.
* What are the recommendations for water intake?

**Module 4: Energy Balance and Weight Management**

Energy Intake vs. Energy Expenditure:
* Explain the concept of energy balance.
* What factors contribute to energy intake and energy expenditure?

Body Mass Index (BMI):
* Briefly introduce BMI as a measure of body weight relative to height.

Regulation of Hunger and Satiety:
* Briefly discuss the hormonal and neural signals that regulate appetite.

Healthy Weight Management:
* Discuss the principles of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise.

Infant and Childhood Nutrition:
* Emphasize the importance of breastfeeding and appropriate nutrition for growth and development.

Adolescent Nutrition:
* Briefly discuss the nutritional needs of adolescents.

Nutrition in Older Adults:
* Discuss the unique nutritional challenges and recommendations for older adults.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Nutritional Disorders and Support**

Malnutrition:
* Define malnutrition and discuss its causes and consequences.

Eating Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of eating disorders (e.g., anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa).

Obesity and Its Health Implications:
* Discuss the health risks associated with obesity.

Nutritional Support:
* Briefly mention different forms of nutritional support (e.g., enteral and parenteral nutrition).

Pharmacological Interactions with Nutrition:
* Briefly discuss how certain medications can affect nutrient absorption or metabolism.

# Blood and Hematology: The River of Life

**Module 1: Introduction to Blood**

Defining Blood:
* What is blood? What type of tissue is it?
* What are the primary functions of blood?

Components of Blood:
* List the two main components of blood.
* What is plasma? Describe its composition.
* What are the formed elements? List the three main types.

**Module 2: Plasma - The Fluid Matrix**

Composition of Plasma:
* Detail the major components of plasma:
    * Water
    * Plasma proteins (albumins, globulins, fibrinogen) - describe their functions.
    * Electrolytes
    * Nutrients
    * Respiratory gases
    * Hormones
    * Waste products

Functions of Plasma:
* Explain the roles of plasma in transport, buffering, and maintaining osmotic pressure.

**Module 3: Formed Elements - Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells)**

Structure of Erythrocytes:
* Describe the unique structure of red blood cells (shape, lack of nucleus and organelles).
* How does their structure relate to their function?

Hemoglobin:
* Describe the structure and function of hemoglobin.
* How does hemoglobin transport oxygen and carbon dioxide?

Erythropoiesis:
* Define erythropoiesis. Where does it occur?
* Describe the regulation of erythropoiesis by erythropoietin (EPO).

Red Blood Cell Life Cycle and Destruction:
* What is the typical lifespan of a red blood cell?
* Describe the process of red blood cell breakdown and the fate of its components.

**Module 4: Formed Elements - Leukocytes (White Blood Cells)**

General Characteristics of Leukocytes:
* What is the general function of white blood cells?
* How do they differ from red blood cells?
* Describe diapedesis and chemotaxis.

Granulocytes:
* Describe the structure and function of neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils.

Agranulocytes:
* Describe the structure and function of lymphocytes and monocytes.

Leukopoiesis:
* Define leukopoiesis. Where does it occur?
* Briefly describe the regulation of leukopoiesis by cytokines.

**Module 5: Formed Elements - Thrombocytes (Platelets)**

Structure of Thrombocytes:
* Describe the structure of platelets. How do they differ from cells?

Hemostasis:
* Define hemostasis. What are the three main phases?
* Describe the role of platelets in vascular spasm, platelet plug formation, and coagulation.

Thrombopoiesis:
* Define thrombopoiesis. Where does it occur?
* Briefly describe the regulation of thrombopoiesis by thrombopoietin (TPO).

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Hematological Disorders**

Anemias:
* Define anemia and list common causes (e.g., iron deficiency, blood loss, sickle cell anemia).

Polycythemia:
* Define polycythemia and list potential causes.

Leukemias:
* Define leukemia and briefly describe different types.

Leukopenia and Leukocytosis:
* Define these terms and their potential causes.

Thrombocytopenia and Thrombocytosis:
* Define these terms and their potential causes.

Blood Typing and Transfusions:
* Explain the ABO and Rh blood groups and their importance in blood transfusions.

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Provide examples of drugs used to treat hematological disorders (e.g., EPO, anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs).

# Circulation in the Central Nervous System (CNS)

**Module 1: Introduction to CNS Circulation**

Importance of Blood Supply:
* Explain why a constant and adequate blood supply is crucial for the function of the central nervous system (CNS).
* What are the metabolic demands of neural tissue?

Overview of Circulation:
* Briefly describe the two main components of circulation in the CNS: blood supply and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.

**Module 2: Blood Supply to the Brain**

Arterial Supply:
* Describe the two main arterial systems that supply blood to the brain:
    * Carotid Arteries (internal carotid arteries): Regions supplied.
    * Vertebral Arteries: Formation from subclavian arteries, basilar artery, regions supplied.
* Explain the Circle of Willis (cerebral arterial circle) and its significance in providing collateral circulation. Name the arteries that form the Circle of Willis.

Venous Drainage:
* Describe the venous drainage of the brain into dural venous sinuses.
* Name the major dural venous sinuses (e.g., superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus).
* Explain how blood from the dural sinuses eventually drains into the internal jugular veins.

**Module 3: Blood Supply to the Spinal Cord**

Arterial Supply:
* Describe the arterial supply to the spinal cord:
    * Anterior Spinal Artery: Origin and regions supplied.
    * Posterior Spinal Arteries (paired): Origin and regions supplied.
    * Segmental Arteries (radicular arteries): Origin and contribution to spinal cord blood flow.

Venous Drainage:
* Describe the venous drainage of the spinal cord via the internal and external vertebral venous plexuses.
* Explain how these plexuses drain into systemic veins.

**Module 4: The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)**

Structure of the BBB:
* Describe the anatomical components of the blood-brain barrier (tight junctions in endothelial cells, thick basement membrane, astrocyte foot processes).

Function of the BBB:
* Explain the selective permeability of the BBB and its role in protecting the brain from harmful substances and maintaining a stable internal environment.
* What types of substances can readily cross the BBB? What substances are restricted?

Circumventricular Organs:
* Describe the circumventricular organs and their unique characteristic of lacking a tight BBB. What is their functional significance?

**Module 5: Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Circulation**

Production of CSF:
* Explain where CSF is produced (choroid plexuses in the ventricles).

Ventricular System:
* Describe the four ventricles of the brain (lateral ventricles, third ventricle, fourth ventricle) and their connections (interventricular foramina, cerebral aqueduct).

Flow of CSF:
* Trace the flow of CSF from the ventricles into the subarachnoid space.

Absorption of CSF:
* Explain how CSF is absorbed back into the venous blood via arachnoid granulations (villi) into the dural venous sinuses.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance: Disorders of CNS Circulation**

Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accident):
* Describe the two main types of stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and their impact on brain blood flow.

Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):
* Briefly explain TIA and its significance.

Spinal Cord Infarction:
* Briefly discuss the causes and consequences of interrupted blood flow to the spinal cord.

Hydrocephalus:
* Explain the different types of hydrocephalus and how they result from disruptions in CSF flow or absorption.

Disruption of the Blood-Brain Barrier:
* Briefly discuss conditions that can compromise the BBB and their implications (e.g., infection, trauma, tumors).

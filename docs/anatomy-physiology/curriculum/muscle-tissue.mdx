# Muscle Tissue: Movement and Contraction

**Module 1: Introduction to Muscle Tissue**

Defining Muscle Tissue:
* What is muscle tissue? What is its primary characteristic?
* What are the four main characteristics of muscle tissue?
* What are the three main types of muscle tissue found in the human body?

Overview of Muscle Tissue Functions:
* Briefly describe the major functions of muscle tissue:
    * Movement
    * Maintaining Posture
    * Stabilizing Joints
    * Heat Generation

**Module 2: Skeletal Muscle Tissue - Voluntary Movement**

Structure of Skeletal Muscle:
* Describe the organization of skeletal muscle from gross anatomy (muscle, fascicles, fibers) to cellular level (myofibrils, sarcomeres).
* What are the key structural components of a muscle fiber (sarcolemma, sarcoplasm, sarcoplasmic reticulum, T-tubules)?
* Describe the arrangement of contractile proteins (actin and myosin) within a sarcomere. What creates the striated appearance?

Mechanism of Skeletal Muscle Contraction:
* Explain the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction.
* Describe the roles of the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine, the action potential, and calcium ions in initiating contraction.
* Explain the cross-bridge cycle: attachment, power stroke, detachment, and cocking of the myosin head.
* What is the role of ATP in muscle contraction and relaxation?

Skeletal Muscle Fiber Types:
* Compare and contrast the characteristics of slow oxidative (Type I), fast oxidative (Type IIa), and fast glycolytic (Type IIb) muscle fibers in terms of speed of contraction, fatigue resistance, and primary metabolic pathway.

**Module 3: Cardiac Muscle Tissue - The Heartbeat**

Structure of Cardiac Muscle:
* Describe the structure of cardiac muscle cells. How do they differ from skeletal muscle fibers (size, shape, nuclei)?
* What are intercalated discs? Describe the functions of desmosomes and gap junctions within intercalated discs.
* Is cardiac muscle striated?

Mechanism of Cardiac Muscle Contraction:
* Explain how cardiac muscle contraction is initiated (autorhythmicity and nervous/hormonal influences).
* Describe the role of calcium ions in cardiac muscle contraction.
* How does the refractory period in cardiac muscle differ from skeletal muscle, and why is this important?

**Module 4: Smooth Muscle Tissue - Involuntary Actions**

Structure of Smooth Muscle:
* Describe the structure of smooth muscle cells. How do they differ from skeletal and cardiac muscle (shape, size, nuclei, striations, sarcomeres)?
* Explain the arrangement of actin and myosin in smooth muscle. What are dense bodies?

Mechanism of Smooth Muscle Contraction:
* Compare and contrast the mechanism of smooth muscle contraction to skeletal muscle contraction, highlighting the roles of calcium, calmodulin, and myosin light chain kinase.
* Explain the latch mechanism in smooth muscle.

Types of Smooth Muscle:
* Distinguish between single-unit (visceral) and multi-unit smooth muscle in terms of their organization, innervation, and contraction patterns. Provide examples of where each is found.

**Module 5: Clinical Relevance - Muscle Disorders and Function**

Skeletal Muscle Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common skeletal muscle disorders (e.g., muscle strains, muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis).

Cardiac Muscle Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common cardiac muscle disorders (e.g., myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy).

Smooth Muscle Disorders:
* Briefly describe examples of common smooth muscle disorders (e.g., asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, hypertension).

Pharmacological Influences on Muscle Tissue:
* Provide examples of drugs that affect skeletal muscle (e.g., muscle relaxants), cardiac muscle (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers), and smooth muscle (e.g., bronchodilators, vasodilators).

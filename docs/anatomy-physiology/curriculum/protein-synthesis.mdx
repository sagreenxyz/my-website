# Protein Synthesis: From Gene to Functional Protein

**Module 1: The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology**

DNA as the Blueprint:
* Briefly review the structure and function of DNA as the carrier of genetic information.
* Explain the concept of a gene as a segment of DNA that codes for a functional product (typically a protein).

The Central Dogma:
* Describe the central dogma of molecular biology: DNA -> RNA -> Protein.
* Explain the two main steps involved in protein synthesis: transcription and translation.

The Role of RNA:
* Introduce RNA as a nucleic acid involved in carrying the genetic message from DNA to the protein synthesis machinery.
* Briefly describe the key differences between DNA and RNA (sugar, bases, structure).

**Module 2: Transcription: From DNA to mRNA**

Overview of Transcription:
* Define transcription as the process of synthesizing RNA using a DNA template.
* Where does transcription occur in eukaryotic cells?

Key Steps of Transcription:
* **Initiation:**
    * Identify the promoter region on the DNA.
    * Describe the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter.
    * Explain the role of transcription factors in eukaryotes.
    * Describe the unwinding of the DNA double helix at the transcription start site.
* **Elongation:**
    * Explain how RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template strand.
    * Describe the synthesis of the RNA molecule, adding nucleotides complementary to the DNA template.
    * Note that RNA uses uracil (U) instead of thymine (T).
* **Termination:**
    * Explain how transcription terminates at a specific termination sequence in the DNA.
    * Describe the release of the newly synthesized pre-mRNA molecule from the DNA template.

RNA Processing in Eukaryotes:
* Explain the modifications that pre-mRNA undergoes to become mature messenger RNA (mRNA):
    * **Capping:** Addition of a 5' cap.
    * **Splicing:** Removal of introns (non-coding sequences) and joining of exons (coding sequences) by the spliceosome.
    * **Polyadenylation:** Addition of a poly-A tail at the 3' end.
* What is the significance of these processing steps for mRNA stability and translation?

**Module 3: Translation: From mRNA to Protein**

Overview of Translation:
* Define translation as the process of synthesizing a polypeptide chain (protein) using the information encoded in mRNA.
* Where does translation occur in eukaryotic cells?

The Genetic Code:
* Explain the concept of the genetic code as a triplet code (codons) in mRNA that specifies amino acids.
* What is a codon? How many possible codons are there?
* Explain the redundancy (degeneracy) of the genetic code.
* Identify the start codon (AUG) and its role in initiating translation.
* Identify the stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) and their role in terminating translation.

Transfer RNA (tRNA): The Amino Acid Carrier:
* Describe the structure of tRNA and its anticodon region.
* Explain how tRNA molecules are "charged" with specific amino acids by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.

Ribosomes: The Protein Synthesis Machinery:
* Describe the structure of ribosomes (small and large subunits, rRNA and proteins).
* Identify the three binding sites for tRNA on the ribosome (A site, P site, E site).

Key Steps of Translation:
* **Initiation:**
    * Describe the binding of mRNA to the small ribosomal subunit.
    * Explain the role of the initiator tRNA carrying methionine (Met) binding to the start codon (AUG).
    * Describe the binding of the large ribosomal subunit to form the initiation complex.
* **Elongation:**
    * Explain the cyclical process of amino acid addition:
        * **Codon recognition:** Binding of the next charged tRNA to the A site.
        * **Peptide bond formation:** Catalyzed by peptidyl transferase in the large subunit, linking the amino acid in the A site to the growing polypeptide in the P site.
        * **Translocation:** Movement of the ribosome one codon down the mRNA, shifting the tRNA in the A site to the P site, the tRNA in the P site to the E site (where it is released), and making the A site available for the next tRNA.
* **Termination:**
    * Explain how stop codons in the mRNA are recognized by release factors.
    * Describe the release of the completed polypeptide chain and the dissociation of the ribosomal subunits.

**Module 4: Post-Translational Modification and Protein Folding**

Protein Folding:
* Explain that the newly synthesized polypeptide chain must fold into its specific three-dimensional conformation to become a functional protein.
* Describe the roles of chaperones in assisting protein folding.

Post-Translational Modifications:
* List and describe common post-translational modifications that proteins can undergo (e.g., glycosylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, proteolytic cleavage).
* Explain how these modifications can affect protein activity, localization, and interactions.

**Module 5: Clinical Relevance: Errors in Protein Synthesis and Therapeutics**

Genetic Mutations and Protein Synthesis:
* Explain how different types of mutations in DNA can affect the mRNA sequence and lead to altered protein synthesis (e.g., point mutations, frameshift mutations).
* Discuss the potential consequences of these altered proteins on cell function and disease.

Ribosomes as Antibiotic Targets:
* Explain how many antibiotics selectively inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by targeting bacterial ribosomes.

Protein Misfolding Diseases:
* Discuss examples of diseases caused by the misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease).

Therapeutic Strategies Targeting Protein Synthesis:
* Briefly mention emerging therapeutic approaches that aim to modulate protein synthesis to treat various diseases.

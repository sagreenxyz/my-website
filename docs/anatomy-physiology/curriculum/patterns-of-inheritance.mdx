# Patterns of Inheritance: How Traits Are Passed Down

**Module 1: Introduction to Patterns of Inheritance**

Defining Inheritance (Heredity):
* What is inheritance, or heredity?
* What is the fundamental unit of inheritance?

Chromosomes and Genes (Review):
* Briefly review the structure of chromosomes and the location of genes.
* What are homologous chromosomes?

Alleles (Review):
* Define alleles and their role in genetic variation.

Genotype and Phenotype (Review):
* Distinguish between genotype and phenotype.

**Module 2: Mendelian Inheritance - Single-Gene Traits**

Mendel's Laws:
* Explain Mendel's Law of Segregation.
* Explain Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment.

Dominant and Recessive Inheritance:
* Describe autosomal dominant inheritance and provide examples.
* Describe autosomal recessive inheritance and provide examples.
* Explain the concept of carriers in recessive inheritance.

Punnett Squares:
* Explain how Punnett squares are used to predict the probability of offspring genotypes and phenotypes.

**Module 3: Beyond Simple Mendelian Inheritance**

Incomplete Dominance:
* Define incomplete dominance and provide examples. How does the heterozygous phenotype differ from the homozygous phenotypes?

Codominance:
* Define codominance and provide examples. How are both alleles expressed in the heterozygous phenotype?

Multiple Alleles:
* Explain the concept of multiple alleles and provide an example (e.g., ABO blood groups).

**Module 4: Sex-Linked Inheritance**

Sex Chromosomes:
* Describe the human sex chromosomes (X and Y).

X-Linked Inheritance:
* Describe X-linked recessive inheritance and provide examples. Why are males more often affected?
* Describe X-linked dominant inheritance and provide examples.

Y-Linked Inheritance:
* Briefly describe Y-linked inheritance.

**Module 5: Complex Inheritance Patterns**

Polygenic Inheritance:
* Define polygenic inheritance and explain how multiple genes contribute to a single trait. Provide examples (e.g., height, skin color).

Multifactorial Inheritance:
* Define multifactorial inheritance and explain the interaction of both genetic and environmental factors in the expression of a trait or disorder. Provide examples (e.g., heart disease, diabetes).

Mitochondrial Inheritance:
* Briefly describe mitochondrial inheritance. Why is it different from nuclear inheritance?

**Module 6: Pedigree Analysis**

What is a Pedigree?
* Define a pedigree and explain the symbols used to represent family members and their traits.

Analyzing Pedigrees:
* Explain how pedigrees are used to trace inheritance patterns of genetic traits and disorders through families.
* Describe how to identify autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and sex-linked patterns on a pedigree.

**Module 7: Clinical Relevance - Genetic Disorders and Counseling**

Inherited Genetic Disorders:
* Briefly discuss the impact of different inheritance patterns on the occurrence and transmission of genetic disorders.

Genetic Counseling:
* Explain the role of genetic counselors in helping individuals and families understand inheritance patterns and the risk of genetic disorders.

Genetic Testing:
* Briefly mention the use of genetic testing to identify alleles associated with inherited conditions.

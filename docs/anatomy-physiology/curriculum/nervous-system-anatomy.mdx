# Anatomy of the Nervous System

**Module 1: Overview of the Nervous System**

Divisions of the Nervous System:
* Describe the two major divisions of the nervous system: the Central Nervous System (CNS) and the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS).
* Briefly outline the components of each division.

Functions of the Nervous System:
* Briefly review the main functions of the nervous system: sensory input, integration, and motor output.

**Module 2: The Central Nervous System (CNS)**

The Brain:
* Describe the four main parts of the adult brain:
    * Cerebrum: Hemispheres, lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital), cortex, white matter, basal nuclei.
    * Diencephalon: Thalamus, hypothalamus, epithalamus.
    * Brainstem: Midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata.
    * Cerebellum: Hemispheres, arbor vitae.
* Briefly describe the major functions of each of these brain regions.

The Spinal Cord:
* Describe the structure of the spinal cord: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal regions; gray matter (horns), white matter (columns), central canal.
* Briefly explain the main functions of the spinal cord (conduction pathway, reflex center).

Protection of the CNS:
* Describe the protective role of the skull and vertebral column.
* Describe the meninges (dura mater, arachnoid mater, pia mater) and their functions.
* Explain the formation and function of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

**Module 3: The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**

Nerves and Ganglia:
* Describe the structure of a nerve.
* What is a ganglion?

Cranial Nerves:
* Name the twelve pairs of cranial nerves.
* Briefly describe the primary function (sensory, motor, or mixed) of each cranial nerve.

Spinal Nerves:
* Describe the formation of a spinal nerve (dorsal and ventral roots).
* What are spinal nerve rami (dorsal and ventral)?
* Define a nerve plexus and name the major nerve plexuses (cervical, brachial, lumbar, sacral).
* Briefly describe the general distribution and function of nerves arising from these plexuses.

**Module 4: Sensory Division of the PNS**

Sensory Receptors:
* Classify sensory receptors by type of stimulus (mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, photoreceptors, chemoreceptors, nociceptors) and by location (exteroceptors, interoceptors, proprioceptors).
* Briefly describe the function of each receptor type.

Sensory Pathways:
* Explain the concept of sensory pathways carrying information from receptors to the CNS.
* Briefly describe the general organization of ascending pathways in the spinal cord.

**Module 5: Motor Division of the PNS**

Somatic Nervous System:
* Describe the somatic nervous system and its control of skeletal muscles.
* Briefly review the neuromuscular junction.

Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):
* Describe the two main divisions of the ANS: sympathetic and parasympathetic.
* Compare and contrast their preganglionic and postganglionic neurons, ganglia locations, and neurotransmitters.
* Briefly describe the general effects of each division on target organs.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance: Anatomical Considerations**

Brain Lesions and Function:
* Briefly discuss how damage to specific anatomical regions of the brain can result in predictable functional deficits.

Spinal Cord Injuries:
* Explain how the location and severity of spinal cord injuries affect sensory and motor function.

Peripheral Nerve Injuries:
* Briefly discuss how damage to peripheral nerves can lead to sensory loss and muscle weakness.

Imaging Techniques:
* Briefly mention the use of medical imaging (e.g., MRI, CT scans) in visualizing the anatomy of the nervous system.

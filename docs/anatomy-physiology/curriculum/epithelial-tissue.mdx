# Epithelial Tissue: Covering, Lining, and Glandular Functions

**Module 1: Introduction to Epithelial Tissue**

Defining Epithelial Tissue:
* What is epithelial tissue? Where is it typically found in the body?
* What are the two main forms of epithelial tissue?
* What are the primary functions of epithelial tissue?

General Characteristics of Epithelial Tissue:
* List and describe the key characteristics of epithelial tissues:
    * Cellularity
    * Specialized Contacts
    * Polarity (Apical and Basal Surfaces)
    * Support by Connective Tissue (Basal Lamina)
    * Avascular but Innervated
    * Regeneration

**Module 2: Covering and Lining Epithelia - Classification by Structure**

Cell Shape:
* Describe the three basic cell shapes of epithelial tissue:
    * Squamous
    * Cuboidal
    * Columnar

Number of Layers:
* Describe the two classifications based on the number of cell layers:
    * Simple
    * Stratified

Classification Types and Functions:
* Describe the following types of covering and lining epithelia, including their structure, specific functions, and typical locations:
    * **Simple Epithelia:**
        * Simple Squamous Epithelium
        * Simple Cuboidal Epithelium
        * Simple Columnar Epithelium
        * Pseudostratified Columnar Epithelium
    * **Stratified Epithelia:**
        * Stratified Squamous Epithelium (Keratinized and Nonkeratinized)
        * Stratified Cuboidal Epithelium
        * Stratified Columnar Epithelium
        * Transitional Epithelium

**Module 3: Specialized Features of Epithelial Cells**

Apical Surface Specializations:
* Describe common modifications of the apical surface of epithelial cells and their functions:
    * Microvilli
    * Cilia

Intercellular Connections:
* Describe the different types of cell junctions that unite epithelial cells and their roles in maintaining tissue integrity and function:
    * Tight Junctions
    * Adherens Junctions
    * Desmosomes
    * Gap Junctions

Basal Surface Specializations:
* Describe the basal lamina and its components. What are its functions in supporting epithelial tissue?

**Module 4: Glandular Epithelium - Secretory Tissue**

Types of Glands:
* Distinguish between exocrine and endocrine glands based on their mode of secretion and the destination of their products.

Exocrine Glands:
* Describe the structure of multicellular exocrine glands (duct and secretory unit).
* Classify multicellular exocrine glands based on duct structure (simple vs. compound) and secretory unit structure (tubular, alveolar, tubuloalveolar).
* Describe different modes of secretion in exocrine glands (merocrine, apocrine, holocrine) and provide examples.

Endocrine Glands:
* Describe the structure of endocrine glands and how they secrete hormones.
* Explain how hormones travel to target organs.

**Module 5: Clinical Relevance - Epithelial Disorders and Functions**

Epithelial Barriers and Protection:
* Discuss the role of epithelial tissue as a protective barrier against physical damage, abrasion, and pathogens.
* Explain how disruptions in epithelial barriers can lead to infections or other complications.

Epithelial Transport and Absorption:
* Describe how specialized epithelial cells facilitate the transport and absorption of substances (e.g., in the digestive tract and kidneys).
* Discuss disorders related to impaired epithelial transport.

Epithelial Cancers (Carcinomas):
* Explain that most cancers arise from epithelial tissues.
* Briefly discuss the characteristics of carcinomas and factors contributing to their development.

Glandular Disorders:
* Provide examples of disorders affecting exocrine glands (e.g., cystic fibrosis) and endocrine glands (e.g., thyroid disorders).

Therapeutic Targeting of Epithelia:
* Briefly mention examples of how epithelial tissues are targets for pharmacological interventions (e.g., topical medications for skin conditions, drugs affecting glandular secretions).

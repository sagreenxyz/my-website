# The Parathyroid Glands: Guardians of Calcium Homeostasis

**Module 1: Introduction to the Parathyroid Glands**

Defining the Parathyroid Glands:
* Describe the location and gross anatomy of the parathyroid glands.
* What is the primary hormone secreted by the parathyroid glands?

**Module 2: Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) - The Key Regulator of Blood Calcium**

Synthesis and Release of PTH:
* Describe the cells in the parathyroid glands that synthesize and secrete PTH (chief cells).
* What is the primary stimulus for PTH release?

Target Organs of PTH:
* Identify the three main target organs of PTH.

Effects of PTH on Bone:
* Explain how PTH affects osteoblasts and osteoclasts to increase calcium release from bone.

Effects of PTH on Kidneys:
* Describe how PTH affects calcium reabsorption and phosphate excretion in the kidneys.
* Explain the role of PTH in activating vitamin D in the kidneys.

Effects of PTH on the Intestines (Indirect):
* Explain the indirect effect of PTH on calcium absorption in the intestines via vitamin D.

**Module 3: Regulation of PTH Release**

Negative Feedback Control:
* Describe the negative feedback loop involving blood calcium levels and PTH secretion.

Other Influencing Factors:
* Briefly mention the role of phosphate levels in influencing PTH secretion.

**Module 4: Clinical Relevance - Parathyroid Disorders - Hyperparathyroidism**

Primary Hyperparathyroidism:
* Describe the common causes of primary hyperparathyroidism (e.g., parathyroid adenoma).
* List the common signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia resulting from hyperparathyroidism.

Secondary Hyperparathyroidism:
* Describe the common causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism (e.g., chronic kidney disease, vitamin D deficiency).
* Explain the compensatory mechanisms involved.

**Module 5: Clinical Relevance - Parathyroid Disorders - Hypoparathyroidism**

Causes of Hypoparathyroidism:
* Describe common causes of hypoparathyroidism (e.g., surgical removal of thyroid/parathyroid glands, autoimmune destruction).

Signs and Symptoms:
* List the common signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia resulting from hypoparathyroidism.

**Module 6: Pharmacology Targeting the Parathyroid Glands and PTH Action**

PTH Analogs:
* Provide examples of PTH analogs used to treat osteoporosis (e.g., teriparatide).

Calcimimetics:
* Describe the mechanism of action of calcimimetics and their use in treating hyperparathyroidism (e.g., cinacalcet).

Vitamin D Analogs:
* Explain the use of vitamin D analogs in managing hypoparathyroidism and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Phosphate Binders:
* Briefly mention the use of phosphate binders in managing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with kidney disease.

# The Immune System: Protecting the Body from Disease

**Module 1: Introduction to the Immune System**

Defining the Immune System:
* What is the immune system?
* What is its primary function?
* Differentiate between innate and adaptive immunity.

Components of the Immune System:
* List the major components of the immune system (cells, tissues, organs).

**Module 2: Innate Immunity - The First Line of Defense**

Surface Barriers:
* Describe the physical and chemical barriers that form the body's first line of defense (e.g., skin, mucous membranes, secretions).

Internal Defenses:
* Describe the key components of the innate internal defenses:
    * Phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils) and phagocytosis.
    * Natural Killer (NK) cells.
    * Inflammatory response (purpose and key events).
    * Antimicrobial proteins (interferons, complement).
    * Fever.

**Module 3: Adaptive Immunity - The Third Line of Defense**

Characteristics of Adaptive Immunity:
* Describe the key characteristics of adaptive immunity (specificity, systemic response, memory).
* Differentiate between humoral and cellular immunity.

Antigens:
* Define antigens and explain their role in adaptive immune responses.
* What are haptens?

Cells of Adaptive Immunity:
* Describe the roles of B lymphocytes (B cells) and T lymphocytes (T cells).
* What are antigen-presenting cells (APCs)? Provide examples.

**Module 4: Humoral Immunity - Antibody-Mediated Immunity**

B Cell Activation and Differentiation:
* Describe the activation of B cells by antigens and helper T cells.
* Explain the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells and memory B cells.

Antibodies (Immunoglobulins):
* Describe the basic structure and functions of antibodies.
* List and briefly describe the different classes of antibodies (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE).

Antibody Actions:
* Explain the mechanisms by which antibodies eliminate antigens (neutralization, agglutination, precipitation, complement fixation).

Immunological Memory:
* Describe the primary and secondary immune responses.

**Module 5: Cellular Immunity - Cell-Mediated Immunity**

T Cell Activation and Differentiation:
* Describe the activation of T cells by antigens presented on MHC molecules by APCs.
* Differentiate between helper T cells (CD4+) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+).
* Explain the roles of memory T cells.

Helper T Cell Function:
* Describe the role of helper T cells in activating B cells and cytotoxic T cells.

Cytotoxic T Cell Function:
* Describe how cytotoxic T cells eliminate infected or cancerous cells.

**Module 6: Clinical Relevance - Disorders of the Immune System**

Immunodeficiency:
* Define immunodeficiency and provide examples (e.g., HIV/AIDS, SCID).

Autoimmune Disorders:
* Define autoimmunity and provide examples (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis).

Hypersensitivity (Allergies):
* Describe the different types of hypersensitivity reactions (Type I-IV) and provide examples.

Transplantation and Rejection:
* Explain the basis of transplant rejection and the role of MHC molecules.

Pharmacological Interventions:
* Briefly mention immunosuppressants and other drugs used to modulate the immune system.

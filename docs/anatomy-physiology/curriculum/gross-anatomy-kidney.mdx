# Gross Anatomy of the Kidney

**Module 1: Introduction to Kidney Anatomy**

Location and Orientation:
* Describe the location of the kidneys within the abdominal cavity.
* Explain their retroperitoneal position.
* Describe the orientation of the kidneys (e.g., which pole is superior/inferior).

Size and Shape:
* Describe the approximate size and characteristic bean shape of the kidney.

**Module 2: External Anatomy**

Renal Capsule:
* Describe the fibrous capsule that surrounds each kidney.

Renal Hilum:
* Identify the renal hilum and the structures that enter and exit at this point (renal artery, renal vein, ureter, lymphatic vessels, nerves).

Renal Cortex:
* Describe the outer region of the kidney, the renal cortex.

Renal Medulla:
* Describe the inner region of the kidney, the renal medulla, and its characteristic structures (renal pyramids).

Renal Poles:
* Identify the superior and inferior poles of the kidney.

Anterior and Posterior Surfaces:
* Briefly describe the general appearance of the anterior and posterior surfaces.

**Module 3: Internal Anatomy**

Renal Pyramids:
* Describe the cone-shaped structures within the renal medulla.
* Identify the base and apex (papilla) of a renal pyramid.

Renal Columns:
* Describe the cortical tissue that extends inward between the renal pyramids.

Renal Pelvis:
* Describe the funnel-shaped structure formed by the expanded upper end of the ureter.

Major and Minor Calyces:
* Describe the cup-like extensions of the renal pelvis that surround the renal papillae and collect urine.

Renal Sinus:
* Describe the cavity within the kidney that contains the renal pelvis, calyces, and branches of the renal blood vessels and nerves.

**Module 4: Supporting Structures**

Adipose Capsule:
* Describe the layer of fatty tissue that surrounds the renal capsule and cushions the kidney.

Renal Fascia:
* Describe the outer layer of dense fibrous connective tissue that anchors the kidney and adrenal gland to surrounding structures.

**Module 5: Vascularization (Brief Overview)**

Renal Artery:
* Briefly mention the entry of the renal artery at the hilum.

Renal Vein:
* Briefly mention the exit of the renal vein at the hilum.

(Detailed vascularization will be covered in a separate module on blood supply to the kidneys).

**Module 6: Innervation (Brief Overview)**

Nerve Supply:
* Briefly mention the innervation of the kidney by the renal plexus (sympathetic nerve fibers).

(Detailed innervation will be covered in a separate module on nervous control of the urinary system).

# Introduction to the Lymphatic System

The lymphatic system is composed of two major divisions: one deals with the circulation of fluids and the other with the topic of the immune system. This section will be divided into both, the **Circulatory Lymphatics**, and **Immune System**.

Components of the circulatory aspect of the lymphatic system are very much a part of the immune system and integral to its function. After describing the lymphatic system as systemic vessels for circulatory flow, the discussion will transition into specifics of those components as they work in an immune system function.

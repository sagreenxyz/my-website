# Summary: 21.6 Diseases Associated with Depressed or Overactive Immune Responses

This section covers disorders resulting from insufficient (immunodeficiency) or excessive/misdirected (hypersensitivity, autoimmunity) immune activity.

## Immunodeficiencies:

*   Impaired ability of the immune system to fight infection and cancer.
*   **Primary (Congenital):** Genetic defects affecting immune cell development or function (e.g., SCID - Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, affecting both B and T cells). Rare.
*   **Secondary (Acquired):** Result from external factors damaging the immune system. More common.
    *   **Causes:** Malnutrition, stress, certain infections (e.g., HIV), medical treatments (chemotherapy, immunosuppressive drugs for transplants/autoimmunity).
    *   **HIV/AIDS:** Human Immunodeficiency Virus infects and destroys T<sub>H</sub> (CD4+) cells, crippling the adaptive immune response and leading to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), characterized by opportunistic infections and cancers.

## Hypersensitivities:

*   Exaggerated or inappropriate immune responses to harmless antigens (allergens). Classified into four types:
*   **Type I (Immediate Hypersensitivity / Allergy):**
    *   Mediated by IgE antibodies bound to mast cells and basophils.
    *   **Sensitization:** Initial exposure leads to IgE production.
    *   **Subsequent Exposure:** Allergen cross-links IgE on mast cells, triggering degranulation and release of histamine, leukotrienes, etc.
    *   **Effects:** Vasodilation, increased permeability, smooth muscle contraction (e.g., hay fever, hives, asthma, anaphylaxis - a severe systemic reaction).
*   **Type II (Cytotoxic Hypersensitivity):**
    *   IgG or IgM antibodies bind to antigens *on cell surfaces*.
    *   Leads to cell destruction via complement activation or ADCC.
    *   **Examples:** Transfusion reactions (ABO incompatibility), hemolytic disease of the newborn (Rh incompatibility), some drug reactions.
*   **Type III (Immune Complex Hypersensitivity):**
    *   Excessive formation of antigen-antibody (IgG/IgM) complexes in circulation.
    *   Complexes deposit in tissues (e.g., blood vessel walls, kidneys, joints).
    *   Activate complement, attract neutrophils, causing inflammation and tissue damage (vasculitis, glomerulonephritis).
    *   **Examples:** Serum sickness, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
*   **Type IV (Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity - DTH):**
    *   Cell-mediated (T cells), not antibody-mediated. Takes 24-72 hours to develop.
    *   **Mechanism:** Sensitized T<sub>H</sub>1 cells encounter antigen, release cytokines, activating macrophages and causing inflammation and tissue damage. T<sub>C</sub> cells can also be involved.
    *   **Examples:** Contact dermatitis (poison ivy, nickel allergy), tuberculin skin test reaction, chronic asthma, transplant rejection (partially).

## Autoimmune Diseases:

*   Immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues (loss of self-tolerance).
*   **Causes:** Complex interplay of genetic predisposition (MHC genes often implicated) and environmental triggers (e.g., infections). Molecular mimicry (pathogen antigen resembles self-antigen) is one proposed mechanism.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Organ-specific:** Type 1 diabetes (pancreatic Î² cells), Graves' disease (thyroid TSH receptor), Myasthenia gravis (acetylcholine receptors).
    *   **Systemic:** Rheumatoid arthritis (joints), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) (multiple organs - DNA, nuclear proteins), Multiple Sclerosis (myelin sheath).
*   **Treatment:** Often involves immunosuppressive drugs to reduce the autoimmune attack.

Understanding these disorders is crucial for diagnosis and developing targeted therapies.

# Summary: 21.7 Transplantation and Cancer Immunology

This section discusses the immune responses involved in organ transplantation and the interaction between the immune system and cancer.

## Transplantation Immunology:

*   **Goal:** Replace damaged or failing organs/tissues.
*   **Challenge:** The recipient's immune system recognizes the donor tissue (graft) as foreign due to differences in Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules (called Human Leukocyte Antigens or HLA in humans).
*   **Rejection:** Immune response against the graft, primarily mediated by T cells recognizing foreign MHC molecules.
    *   **T<sub>C</sub> cells:** Directly kill graft cells presenting foreign MHC I.
    *   **T<sub>H</sub> cells:** Recognize foreign MHC II on APCs within the graft or recipient APCs presenting donor antigens, leading to inflammation and activation of other immune cells.
    *   **Antibodies:** Can contribute, especially in hyperacute rejection (pre-existing antibodies) or chronic rejection.
*   **Types of Rejection:**
    *   **Hyperacute:** Minutes/hours; due to pre-existing antibodies against donor antigens (e.g., ABO blood groups, previous sensitization). Rare now due to cross-matching.
    *   **Acute:** Days/weeks; primarily T cell-mediated response against foreign MHC.
    *   **Chronic:** Months/years; slow, progressive graft damage involving both cellular and humoral immunity, fibrosis.
*   **Minimizing Rejection:**
    *   **MHC (HLA) Matching:** Selecting donors with HLA types as close as possible to the recipient reduces the intensity of the immune response. Family members are often better matches.
    *   **Immunosuppressive Drugs:** Essential for almost all allografts (grafts between genetically different individuals of the same species). These drugs suppress T cell activation/proliferation (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, corticosteroids). Increases susceptibility to infections and cancer.
*   **Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD):** Occurs mainly in bone marrow transplants. Immune cells (T cells) *in the graft* recognize the *recipient's* tissues as foreign and attack them. Requires immunosuppression of the graft or removal of T cells from it.

## Cancer Immunology:

*   **Concept:** The immune system can recognize and eliminate cancerous cells (immune surveillance).
*   **Tumor Antigens:** Cancer cells often express abnormal proteins or overexpress normal proteins that can be recognized by the immune system.
    *   **Tumor-Specific Antigens (TSAs):** Unique to tumor cells (e.g., mutated proteins).
    *   **Tumor-Associated Antigens (TAAs):** Also found on normal cells but overexpressed or aberrantly expressed on tumor cells (e.g., developmental antigens).
*   **Immune Response to Cancer:**
    *   **T<sub>C</sub> cells:** Recognize tumor antigens presented on MHC I and kill cancer cells.
    *   **NK cells:** Kill tumor cells that have reduced MHC I expression or express stress ligands.
    *   **Macrophages:** Can kill tumor cells (e.g., via ADCC) and present tumor antigens.
    *   **Antibodies:** Can mediate ADCC or activate complement against tumor cells.
*   **Immune Evasion by Cancer:** Tumors develop strategies to escape immune destruction:
    *   Reduced MHC I expression.
    *   Secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., TGF-Î²).
    *   Expression of inhibitory ligands (e.g., PD-L1) that suppress T cell activity.
    *   Induction of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>).
    *   Poor antigenicity (lack of strong tumor antigens).
*   **Cancer Immunotherapy:** Harnessing the immune system to fight cancer.
    *   **Monoclonal Antibodies:** Target tumor antigens (e.g., Herceptin for HER2+ breast cancer) or block immune checkpoints (e.g., anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4) to release the brakes on T cells.
    *   **Cancer Vaccines:** Stimulate an immune response against tumor antigens.
    *   **Adoptive Cell Transfer (ACT):** Isolating, expanding, and sometimes genetically modifying patient's T cells (e.g., CAR-T cells) to target the tumor, then reinfusing them.

Understanding these immune interactions is vital for improving transplant success and developing effective cancer treatments.

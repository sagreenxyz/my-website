# Summary: Chapter 21 Key Terms

This section lists important terminology related to the lymphatic and immune systems discussed in Chapter 21.

*   **Adaptive Immune Response:** Specific, slow, memory-driven response involving T and B lymphocytes.
*   **Afferent Lymphatic Vessels:** Vessels carrying lymph *into* a lymph node.
*   **Antibody:** Protein secreted by plasma cells that binds specific antigens; involved in humoral immunity.
*   **Antigen:** Molecule recognized by B or T cell receptors, often foreign (non-self).
*   **Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC):** Cell (e.g., macrophage, dendritic cell, B cell) that displays processed antigen fragments on MHC molecules to T cells.
*   **Apoptosis:** Programmed cell death.
*   **B Cells (B lymphocytes):** Lymphocytes maturing in bone marrow; mediate humoral immunity via antibody production.
*   **Barrier Defenses:** Physical/chemical blocks preventing pathogen entry (skin, mucous membranes).
*   **Bone Marrow:** Primary lymphoid organ; site of hematopoiesis and B cell maturation.
*   **CD4/CD8:** Surface molecules distinguishing T cell subsets (Helper T cells are CD4+, Cytotoxic T cells are CD8+).
*   **Chyle:** Lipid-rich lymph from the small intestine.
*   **Cisterna Chyli:** Sac-like chamber collecting lymph from lower body/intestines, leads to thoracic duct.
*   **Clonal Expansion:** Proliferation of activated lymphocytes to create a large pool of antigen-specific cells.
*   **Complement System:** Plasma proteins that enhance innate/adaptive immunity (opsonization, inflammation, lysis).
*   **Cytokine:** Signaling protein regulating immune responses.
*   **Cytotoxic T cells (T<sub>C</sub>):** T lymphocytes (CD8+) that kill infected or cancerous cells.
*   **Efferent Lymphatic Vessels:** Vessels carrying lymph *out* of a lymph node.
*   **Helper T cells (T<sub>H</sub>):** T lymphocytes (CD4+) that secrete cytokines to orchestrate immune responses.
*   **Histamine:** Vasoactive mediator released by mast cells/basophils causing inflammation.
*   **Humoral Immunity:** Adaptive immunity mediated by B cells and antibodies.
*   **Immune System:** Cells and organs defending against pathogens and abnormal cells.
*   **Immunological Memory:** Faster, stronger adaptive response upon re-exposure to an antigen due to memory cells.
*   **Immunodeficiency:** State of impaired immune function.
*   **Inflammation:** Innate response to injury/infection (redness, heat, swelling, pain).
*   **Innate Immune Response:** Rapid, non-specific immunity (barriers, phagocytes, NK cells, inflammation, complement).
*   **Interferons:** Cytokines primarily involved in antiviral defense.
*   **Lymph:** Fluid in lymphatic vessels.
*   **Lymph Node:** Bean-shaped secondary lymphoid organ filtering lymph and housing lymphocytes.
*   **Lymphatic Capillaries:** Smallest, open-ended lymphatic vessels collecting interstitial fluid.
*   **Lymphatic System:** Network of vessels, nodes, and organs managing fluid balance and immunity.
*   **Lymphocyte:** Type of white blood cell central to adaptive immunity (T cells, B cells, NK cells).
*   **Lymphoid Nodules:** Unencapsulated clusters of lymphocytes (e.g., tonsils, MALT).
*   **Macrophage:** Large phagocytic cell derived from monocytes; acts as APC.
*   **Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC):** Cell surface proteins presenting antigens to T cells (MHC I - endogenous; MHC II - exogenous).
*   **Mast Cell:** Tissue cell releasing histamine during inflammation/allergy.
*   **Memory Cells:** Long-lived T and B cells providing immunological memory.
*   **Monocyte:** Precursor cell in blood that differentiates into macrophages or dendritic cells.
*   **Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT):** Lymphoid nodules in mucous membranes.
*   **Natural Killer (NK) Cell:** Innate lymphocyte that kills abnormal cells (virus-infected, tumor).
*   **Neutrophil:** Phagocytic granulocyte; first responder to bacterial infections.
*   **Opsonization:** Coating of a pathogen by antibodies or complement to enhance phagocytosis.
*   **Phagocytosis:** Process of engulfing and destroying pathogens or debris.
*   **Plasma Cell:** Differentiated B cell that secretes large amounts of antibodies.
*   **Primary Lymphoid Organ:** Site of lymphocyte development/maturation (bone marrow, thymus).
*   **Secondary Lymphoid Organ:** Site where lymphocytes encounter antigens and initiate adaptive responses (lymph nodes, spleen, nodules).
*   **Spleen:** Secondary lymphoid organ filtering blood, removing old RBCs, housing lymphocytes.
*   **T Cell (T lymphocyte):** Lymphocyte maturing in the thymus; mediates cell-mediated immunity (T<sub>H</sub>, T<sub>C</sub>, T<sub>reg</sub>).
*   **T Cell Receptor (TCR):** Antigen receptor on T cell surface.
*   **Thoracic Duct:** Largest lymphatic vessel draining lymph from most of the body into the bloodstream.
*   **Thymus:** Primary lymphoid organ where T cells mature.
*   **Tonsils:** Lymphoid nodules guarding the pharynx.

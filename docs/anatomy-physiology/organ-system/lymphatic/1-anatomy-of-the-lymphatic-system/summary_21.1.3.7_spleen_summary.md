# Spleen

This document summarizes the structure and function of the spleen, a major secondary lymphoid organ.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Function:**
    *   Acts as the "filter of the blood," removing microbes, cellular debris (including dying red blood cells), and other materials from circulation via macrophages and dendritic cells.
    *   Serves as a major site for initiating and mediating immune responses to blood-borne pathogens.

*   **Location & Characteristics:**
    *   Located attached to the lateral border of the stomach via the gastrosplenic ligament.
    *   Approximately 12 cm (5 in) long.
    *   Fragile organ (lacks a strong capsule).
    *   Dark red color due to extensive vascularization.

*   **Structure:**
    *   Divided into compartments by **trabeculae** (connective tissue extensions).
    *   Contains two main types of tissue within splenic nodules:
        *   **Red Pulp:** Consists mainly of red blood cells, reticular fibers with fixed macrophages, free macrophages, and other blood cells (including some lymphocytes). Primarily functions in blood filtration using innate immune cells.
        *   **White Pulp:** Resembles lymphoid follicles of lymph nodes. Surrounds a central arteriole and consists of germinal centers (dividing B cells) surrounded by T cells and accessory cells (macrophages, dendritic cells). Site where adaptive T and B cell responses to blood-borne antigens are mounted.

*   **Blood Flow:**
    *   Blood enters via the **splenic artery**.
    *   Splits into arterioles (surrounded by white pulp).
    *   Flows into **sinusoids** (within red pulp).
    *   Blood collects in **venous sinuses**.
    *   Exits via the **splenic vein**.

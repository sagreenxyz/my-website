# Anatomy of the Lymphatic and Immune Systems

This section details the physical structures of the lymphatic and immune systems.

## Key Components:

*   **Lymphatic Vessels:** A network of vessels that transport lymph fluid throughout the body. They begin as open-ended capillaries, feed into larger vessels, and eventually empty into the bloodstream.
*   **Lymph:** The fluid contained within lymphatic vessels, similar in composition to interstitial fluid.
*   **Lymph Nodes:** Bean-shaped organs located along lymphatic vessels that filter lymph and house immune cells (lymphocytes). They act as major sites for adaptive immune responses.
*   **Primary Lymphoid Organs:**
    *   **Bone Marrow:** Site of hematopoiesis (blood cell formation), including the production of all lymphocytes. B cells mature here.
    *   **Thymus Gland:** Located behind the sternum, it's the site where T cells mature.
*   **Secondary Lymphoid Organs:** Sites where mature lymphocytes encounter antigens and initiate adaptive immune responses.
    *   **Spleen:** Filters blood, removes old red blood cells, and houses immune cells.
    *   **Lymph Nodes:** Filter lymph.
    *   **Lymphoid Nodules:** Simpler concentrations of lymphoid tissue found in various mucous membranes (e.g., tonsils, MALT - mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue). Examples include Peyer's patches in the small intestine.

## Functions:

*   **Fluid Balance:** Drains excess interstitial fluid and returns it to the bloodstream.
*   **Fat Absorption:** Transports dietary fats absorbed from the small intestine.
*   **Immune Response:** Houses lymphocytes and other immune cells, facilitating immune surveillance and response.

The lymphatic system is crucial for both fluid homeostasis and immunity, working closely with the cardiovascular and immune systems.

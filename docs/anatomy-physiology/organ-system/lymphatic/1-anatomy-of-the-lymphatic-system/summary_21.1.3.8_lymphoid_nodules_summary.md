# Lymphoid Nodules

This document summarizes the structure, function, and types of lymphoid nodules, which are simpler secondary lymphoid tissues.

## Key Concepts:

*   **General Characteristics:**
    *   Simpler architecture compared to lymph nodes and spleen.
    *   Consist of dense clusters of lymphocytes.
    *   Lack a surrounding fibrous capsule.
    *   Located in respiratory and digestive tracts, areas frequently exposed to pathogens.

*   **Types of Lymphoid Nodules:**
    *   **Tonsils:**
        *   Location: Along the inner surface of the pharynx.
        *   Types: Pharyngeal tonsil (adenoid when swollen), palatine tonsils (sides of throat).
        *   Function: Develop immunity to oral pathogens, especially in childhood. Help recognize, destroy, and build immunity to common environmental pathogens.
        *   Structure: Incomplete capsule; epithelium invaginates to form **tonsillar crypts** which trap materials and "encourage" pathogen exposure to underlying lymphoid follicles.
        *   Clinical Note: Often removed (tonsillectomy) due to recurrent infections or swelling obstructing breathing/swallowing.
    *   **Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT):**
        *   Definition: Aggregate of lymphoid follicles directly associated with mucous membrane epithelia.
        *   Location: Dome-shaped structures underlying mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, breast tissue, lungs, and eyes.
        *   **Peyer's Patches:** A specific type of MALT in the small intestine.
            *   Function: Important for immune responses against ingested substances.
            *   Contain specialized **M (microfold) cells** that sample material from the intestinal lumen and transport it to nearby follicles for immune surveillance.
        *   **Appendix:** Contains MALT in its mucosa and submucosa; inflammation can lead to appendicitis.
    *   **Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT):**
        *   Definition: Lymphoid follicular structures associated with the epithelium along bronchial bifurcations and between bronchi/arteries.
        *   Structure: Less organized, similar to other lymphoid nodules.
        *   Function: Effective against inhaled pathogens.

# Lymphoid Organs and Lymphocyte Development

This document describes the primary and secondary lymphoid organs where lymphocytes develop, mature, and mount immune responses.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Primary Lymphoid Organs:** Sites where lymphocytes mature, proliferate, and are selected (learn self-tolerance). Include bone marrow and thymus gland.
    *   **Bone Marrow:**
        *   Site of hematopoiesis (blood cell formation) in adults, occurring in the **red bone marrow**. Yellow bone marrow stores fat.
        *   B cells undergo most development here.
        *   Immature T cells (**thymocytes**) originate here before migrating to the thymus.
    *   **Thymus:**
        *   Bilobed organ located between the sternum and aorta.
        *   Site of T cell maturation.
        *   Structure: Encapsulated, divided into lobules by trabeculae.
            *   **Cortex:** Outer, densely packed region with thymocytes, epithelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells.
            *   **Medulla:** Inner, less dense region where mature thymocytes migrate before exiting.
        *   **Thymic Involution:** Age-related shrinking of the thymus (starts after puberty), leading to decreased naïve T cell production (**immunosenescence**). Linked to genetics (FOXN1 gene) and hormones (sex hormones enhance involution).

*   **Secondary Lymphoid Organs:** Sites where naïve lymphocytes (mature but unactivated) encounter antigens and mount immune responses. Include lymph nodes, spleen, and lymphoid nodules.
    *   **Common Features:**
        *   **Lymphoid follicles:** Sites of lymphocyte formation/activation (B cell-rich and T cell-rich areas).
        *   **Germinal centers:** Areas within follicles with rapidly dividing B cells.
        *   Internal reticular fiber network with fixed macrophages.
        *   **High endothelial venules (HEVs):** Specialized post-capillary vessels allowing blood lymphocytes to enter the organ directly.
    *   **Lymph Nodes:**
        *   Function: "Filters of the lymph," removing debris and pathogens via macrophages and dendritic cells. Site of adaptive immune responses.
        *   Structure: Bean-shaped, encapsulated, divided by trabeculae. Reticular fiber support.
        *   Flow: Lymph enters via **afferent lymphatic vessels** into the subcapsular sinus, flows through cortex (follicles) and medulla (medullary cords and sinuses), and exits via **efferent lymphatic vessels**.
    *   **Spleen:**
        *   Function: "Filter of the blood," removing microbes, debris, and old red blood cells. Site of immune responses to blood-borne pathogens.
        *   Location: Attached to the lateral stomach. Fragile, highly vascularized.
        *   Structure: Contains **red pulp** (blood filtration, RBCs, macrophages) and **white pulp** (lymphoid follicles resembling lymph nodes, surrounds central arterioles, site of adaptive responses). Blood enters via splenic artery, flows through arterioles and sinusoids, exits via splenic vein.
    *   **Lymphoid Nodules:**
        *   Simpler structure: Dense clusters of lymphocytes without a surrounding capsule. Found in respiratory and digestive tracts.
        *   **Tonsils:** Nodules in the pharynx (pharyngeal/adenoid, palatine). Develop immunity to oral pathogens. Have **tonsillar crypts** that trap material.
        *   **Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT):** Aggregates of follicles under mucous membranes (GI tract, breast, lungs, eyes).
            *   **Peyer's patches:** MALT in the small intestine with specialized **M cells** for sampling intestinal contents.
            *   Appendix also contains MALT.
        *   **Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT):** Follicles along bronchi, responding to inhaled pathogens.

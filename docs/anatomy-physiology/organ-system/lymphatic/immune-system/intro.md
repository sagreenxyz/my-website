# Organization of Immune Function and Lymphocytes

This document outlines the organizational model of immune function and details the primary types of lymphocytes involved.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Organization of Immune Function (Three Phases):**
    1.  **Barrier Defenses:** Instantaneous physical/chemical blocks (e.g., skin, mucous membranes) preventing pathogen entry.
    2.  **Innate Immune Response:** Rapid, non-specific response involving specialized cells and soluble factors.
    3.  **Adaptive Immune Response:** Slower, specific, effective response with memory, primarily controlled by lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).

*   **Origin of Immune Cells:**
    *   All blood cells, including immune cells, originate from **hematopoietic stem cells** in the bone marrow throughout adulthood via differentiation.
    *   Functional classes include:
        *   **Phagocytic cells:** Ingest pathogens.
        *   **Lymphocytes:** Coordinate adaptive immunity.
        *   **Cells with cytoplasmic granules:** Mediate various responses (e.g., against parasites, viruses).

*   **Lymphocytes:** Primary cells of adaptive immune responses (~10<sup>12</sup> in the human body). Morphologically similar (large nucleus, thin cytoplasm) but distinguished by surface markers and secretions. Circulate in blood/lymph and reside in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes).
    *   **B Lymphocytes (B cells):**
        *   Develop and mature in **red bone marrow**.
        *   Function primarily by producing **antibodies** (proteins that bind specific **antigens** - pathogen-associated molecules).
        *   Activation by antigen binding causes differentiation into plasma cells.
    *   **T Lymphocytes (T cells):**
        *   Develop in bone marrow, migrate to and mature in the **thymus**.
        *   Do not secrete antibodies directly.
        *   Perform various adaptive functions: secreting soluble factors (cytokines) to communicate or destroying cells infected with intracellular pathogens.
    *   **Plasma Cells:**
        *   Differentiated B cells that have been activated by antigen binding.
        *   Specialized for secreting large quantities of soluble antibodies.
        *   Distinct morphology: large cytoplasm packed with rough endoplasmic reticulum.
    *   **Natural Killer (NK) Cells:**
        *   Participate in the **innate** immune response.
        *   Circulating blood cells containing cytotoxic (cell-killing) granules.
        *   Provide a first line of defense against viruses and certain types of cancer, sharing killing mechanisms with cytotoxic T cells.

## Lymphocyte Summary Table:

| Type of lymphocyte | Primary function                  |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| B lymphocyte      | Generates diverse antibodies      |
| T lymphocyte      | Secretes chemical messengers      |
| Plasma cell        | Secretes antibodies               |
| NK cell            | Destroys virally infected cells |

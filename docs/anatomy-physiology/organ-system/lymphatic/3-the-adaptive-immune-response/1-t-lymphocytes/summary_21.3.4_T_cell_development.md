# Summary: 21.3.4 T Cell Development and Differentiation

This section describes the maturation process of T lymphocytes (thymocytes) within the thymus, focusing on the selection processes that ensure self-tolerance and proper function.

## Key Concepts:

*   **T Cell Tolerance:** The process of eliminating T cells that could potentially attack the body's own cells and tissues. This is crucial for preventing autoimmunity.
*   **Thymocytes:** Immature T cells undergoing development in the thymus.

## Stages of Thymic Development:

1.  **Entry & Double-Negative Stage:**
    *   Thymocytes enter the **cortex** of the thymus.
    *   Initially, they are **"double negatives" (DN)**, lacking both CD4 and CD8 surface markers.
2.  **Positive Selection (in Cortex):**
    *   DN thymocytes interact with **thymic epithelial cells** which display self-MHC molecules (Class I and Class II).
    *   **Goal:** Selects for thymocytes whose T Cell Receptors (TCRs) can weakly bind to self-MHC molecules. This ensures the mature T cell will be able to interact with MHC molecules presenting antigens later on (**MHC restriction**).
    *   Thymocytes that cannot bind self-MHC at all fail positive selection and die via apoptosis.
    *   This is a stringent process; only about 2% of thymocytes successfully pass this stage and eventually leave the thymus.
3.  **Double-Positive Stage:**
    *   Surviving thymocytes move towards the **junction between the cortex and medulla**.
    *   They become **"double positives" (DP)**, expressing both CD4 and CD8 markers.
4.  **Negative Selection (Cortico-Medullary Junction & Medulla):**
    *   DP thymocytes encounter **professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs)** (like dendritic cells and macrophages) that present **self-antigens** brought in from peripheral tissues on both MHC Class I and Class II molecules.
    *   **Goal:** Eliminate thymocytes whose TCRs bind *too strongly* to self-antigen/self-MHC complexes.
    *   Strong binding indicates potential self-reactivity, so these cells are killed by **apoptosis**.
    *   This process removes potentially autoimmune T cells.
5.  **Single-Positive Stage & Exit:**
    *   Thymocytes that survive both positive and negative selection mature into **"single positives" (SP)**, expressing either CD4 *or* CD8, but not both.
        *   If the TCR preferentially interacted with MHC Class II during selection, the cell becomes a **CD4+ T cell**.
        *   If the TCR preferentially interacted with MHC Class I during selection, the cell becomes a **CD8+ T cell**.
    *   These mature, na√Øve T cells (now tolerant to self-antigens and restricted to self-MHC) exit the thymus into the bloodstream.

## Outcome:

*   The thymus produces mature T cells that are:
    *   **Self-MHC Restricted:** Can recognize antigens presented on the body's own MHC molecules.
    *   **Self-Tolerant:** Do not react strongly against the body's own antigens under normal conditions.
*   **CD4+ T cells** are programmed to interact with MHC Class II molecules (typically presenting exogenous antigens).
*   **CD8+ T cells** are programmed to interact with MHC Class I molecules (typically presenting endogenous antigens).
*   **Autoimmunity:** Failure or breakdown of T cell tolerance mechanisms can lead to autoimmune diseases.

# The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes and Their Functional Types

This section focuses on T lymphocytes (T cells), a crucial component of the adaptive immune system, responsible for cell-mediated immunity.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Adaptive Immunity:** A specific, systemic immune response with memory, primarily involving T and B lymphocytes.
*   **T Lymphocytes (T cells):** Originate in bone marrow, mature in the thymus. They recognize specific antigens presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules on other cells.
*   **Antigen Presentation:** Pathogens are processed, and their fragments (antigens) are displayed on cell surfaces by MHC molecules. This process differs based on whether the pathogen is intracellular or extracellular.
    *   **MHC Class I:** Found on almost all nucleated cells. Present *endogenous* antigens, which originate from *inside* the cell (e.g., viral proteins produced during replication within the cell, or abnormal proteins from tumor cells). Recognized by cytotoxic T cells (CD8+). Crucial for detecting **intracellular pathogens**.
    *   **MHC Class II:** Found primarily on Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) like macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. Present *exogenous* antigens, which originate from *outside* the cell and have been engulfed (e.g., bacteria, toxins, or debris from **extracellular pathogens**). Recognized by helper T cells (CD4+).
*   **T Cell Receptor (TCR):** A unique receptor on the surface of each T cell that binds to a specific antigen-MHC complex.
*   **T Cell Maturation & Selection (in Thymus):**
    *   **Positive Selection:** Ensures T cells can recognize self-MHC molecules.
    *   **Negative Selection:** Eliminates T cells that react too strongly to self-antigens presented on self-MHC (prevents autoimmunity).
*   **Clonal Selection and Expansion:** When a T cell encounters its specific antigen-MHC complex, it becomes activated and proliferates rapidly, creating a clone of identical T cells specific for that antigen.

## Functional Types of T Cells:

*   **Helper T cells (T<sub>H</sub> cells, CD4+):**
    *   Recognize antigens presented on MHC Class II molecules by APCs (typically derived from **extracellular pathogens**).
    *   "Orchestrators" of the immune response.
    *   Secrete cytokines to activate and coordinate other immune cells, including cytotoxic T cells (for intracellular threats), B cells (primarily for extracellular threats), and macrophages (for both).
    *   Different subsets (e.g., T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2) influence the type of immune response tailored to the pathogen type.
*   **Cytotoxic T cells (T<sub>C</sub> cells, CD8+):**
    *   Recognize antigens presented on MHC Class I molecules on infected or abnormal body cells (indicating an **intracellular pathogen** like a virus, or a cancerous transformation).
    *   Directly kill target cells by releasing perforins (create pores) and granzymes (induce apoptosis).
    *   Crucial for eliminating virus-infected cells and tumor cells.
*   **Regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub> cells, often CD4+ CD25+):**
    *   Help suppress immune responses, preventing excessive reactions and autoimmunity.
    *   Maintain immune tolerance.
*   **Memory T cells:**
    *   Long-lived cells (both helper and cytotoxic types) formed after an initial infection.
    *   Provide immunological memory, allowing for a faster and stronger response upon re-exposure to the same antigen.

T cell-mediated immunity is essential for controlling **intracellular pathogens** (via T<sub>C</sub> cells) and cancer, while T<sub>H</sub> cells are critical for coordinating responses against both **intracellular and extracellular** threats and regulating overall immune activity.

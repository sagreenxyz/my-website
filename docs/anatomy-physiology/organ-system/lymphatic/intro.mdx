# The Lymphatic System

The lymphatic system is composed of two major divisions: one deals with the circulation of fluids and the other with the topic of the immune system. This section will be divided into both, the **Circulatory Lymphatics**, and **Immune System**.

Components of the circulatory aspect of the lymphatic system are very much a part of the immune system and integral to its function. After describing the lymphatic system as systemic vessels for circulatory flow, the discussion will transition into specifics of those components as they work in an immune system function.

## Introduction

  <TabItem value="summary" label="Summary" default>
*   **Discovery of AIDS (1981):**
    *   CDC reported unusual clusters of rare diseases (**Pneumocystis jirovecii** pneumonia in LA, **Kaposi's sarcoma** in NYC) in young patients.
    *   These diseases typically affect those with suppressed immunity (very young/elderly).
    *   The affected young patients had severely compromised immune systems (low white blood cell counts).
*   **Identification and Impact:**
    *   The new disease was identified as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
    *   Initially almost 100% fatal, HIV is now a manageable chronic disease thanks to anti-HIV drugs.
    *   The emergence of AIDS significantly increased public awareness of the immune system's importance.

## Anatomy of the Lymphatic and Immune System

*   **Immune System:** A complex collection of cells and organs designed to destroy or neutralize pathogens.
*   **Lymphatic System:** A system of vessels, cells, and organs responsible for:
    *   Carrying excess fluids back to the bloodstream.
    *   Filtering pathogens from the blood.
*   **Relationship:** The lymphatic and immune systems are closely linked and often considered indistinguishable.
    *   Examples of connection: Swelling of lymph nodes during infection, transport of lymphocytes via lymphatic vessels.

### Functions of the Lymphatic System

*   **Fluid Drainage:**
    *   A major function is draining excess body fluid (interstitial fluid) from tissue spaces and returning it to the bloodstream.
    *   Blood pressure causes ~20 liters of plasma to leak from capillaries daily into tissues.
    *   ~17 liters are reabsorbed by blood vessels.
    *   The remaining ~3 liters enter the lymphatic system, becoming **lymph**.
    *   Lymph is returned to the blood via lymphatic vessels, trunks, and ducts.
    *   Damage to the lymphatic system can cause **lymphedema** (accumulation of protein-rich interstitial fluid).
*   **Immune Cell Transport:**
    *   Lymphatic vessels serve as transport routes for immune system cells.
    *   **Lymph nodes** (small, bean-shaped organs throughout the system) are key staging areas for developing immune responses.
*   **Dietary Lipid Transport:**
    *   Transports dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins absorbed in the gut.

### Structure of the Lymphatic System

*   **Vessel Structure:**
    *   Lymphatic vessels start as blind-ending capillaries.
    *   These feed into progressively larger lymphatic vessels.
    *   Eventually, they empty lymph into the bloodstream via ducts.
*   **Lymph Flow Path:**
    *   Lymph travels from capillaries through vessels and passes through lymph nodes.
    *   It enters the circulatory system via lymphatic ducts at the junction of the jugular and subclavian veins in the neck.
*   **Lymph Nodes:**
    *   Humans have ~500-600 lymph nodes.
    *   Commonly found near the groin, armpits, neck, chest, and abdomen.
    *   Figure 21.2 illustrates the system's anatomy.
*   **Lymph Movement (vs. Blood):**
    *   Lymph is *not* actively pumped by the heart.
    *   Movement relies on:
        *   Body movements.
        *   Contraction of skeletal muscles.
        *   Breathing.
    *   One-way valves within lymphatic vessels ensure lymph flows towards the heart.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="capillaries" label="Lymphatic Capillaries" default>
*   **Definition:** Vessels where interstitial fluid enters the lymphatic system to become lymph fluid; also called terminal lymphatics.
*   **Location:** Interlaced with arterioles/venules in soft connective tissues; found in almost every tissue.
*   **Exceptions:** Not present in the central nervous system, bone marrow, bones, teeth, and cornea.
*   **Structure:** Formed by a single layer of endothelial cells; represent the open end of the lymphatic system.
*   **Fluid Entry Mechanism:**
    *   Interstitial fluid flows in via overlapping endothelial cells (flaps).
    *   Flaps close when interstitial pressure is low (preventing backflow).
    *   Flaps open when interstitial pressure increases, allowing fluid entry.
    *   Anchoring collagen filaments pull flaps open further as pressure rises.
*   **Lacteals:**
    *   Specialized lymphatic capillaries in the small intestine.
    *   Transport dietary lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins.
    *   Lipids combine with proteins to form **chyle** (milky fluid), which enters lacteals and travels via the lymphatic system to the bloodstream.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="vessels" label="Vessels, Trunks and Ducts">
*   **Lymphatic Vessels:**
    *   Larger vessels receiving lymph from capillaries.
    *   Structure similar to veins (three tunics, one-way valves).
    *   Valves are close together, giving a beaded appearance.
*   **Lymphatic Trunks:**
    *   Formed by the merging of superficial and deep lymphatic vessels.
*   **Lymphatic Ducts (Drainage into Bloodstream):**
    *   **Right Lymphatic Duct:**
        *   Drains lymph from the upper right side of the body (right head, right thorax, right upper limb).
        *   Empties into the right subclavian vein.
    *   **Thoracic Duct:**
        *   Drains lymph from the rest of the body (left side of head/thorax, left upper limb, abdomen, pelvis, lower limbs).
        *   Begins as the **cisterna chyli** (a sac-like chamber below the diaphragm receiving lymph from lower body trunks).
        *   Empties into the left subclavian vein.
*   **Drainage Pattern:**
    *   Asymmetrical: Thoracic duct drains a much larger area than the right lymphatic duct.
*   **Vessel Pathways:**
    *   Superficial lymphatics (skin) generally follow veins.
    *   Deep lymphatics (viscera) generally follow arteries.

### The Organization of Immune Function

*   **Immune System Components:** Barriers, cells, and soluble proteins interacting complexly.
*   **Three Phases of Immune Function (Timing-based):**
    1.  **Barrier Defenses:** Instantaneous (e.g., skin, mucous membranes) prevent pathogen entry.
    2.  **Innate Immune Response:** Rapid, non-specific (specialized cells, soluble factors).
    3.  **Adaptive Immune Response:** Slower, specific, effective (controlled mainly by lymphocytes).
*   **Origin of Immune Cells:**
    *   All blood cells, including immune cells, originate from **hematopoietic stem cells** in the bone marrow.
    *   This process (hematopoiesis) continues throughout adulthood.
*   **Functional Classes of Immune Cells:**
    1.  **Phagocytic Cells:** Ingest and destroy pathogens.
    2.  **Lymphocytes:** Coordinate adaptive immunity.
    3.  **Granular Cells:** Mediate responses against parasites and intracellular pathogens (e.g., viruses).

### Lymphocytes: B Cells, T Cells, Plasma Cells, and Natural Killer Cells

*   **Lymphocytes:** Primary cells of adaptive immune responses.
*   **Main Types:** B cells and T cells.
    *   Morphologically identical (large nucleus, thin cytoplasm).
    *   Distinguished by surface protein markers and secreted molecules.
*   **Origin:** Both develop initially from bone marrow.
*   **Maturation:**
    *   **B cells:** Mature in red bone marrow.
    *   **T cells:** Migrate from bone marrow to the thymus gland for maturation.
*   **Location:** Found circulating in blood/lymph and residing in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes).
*   **Quantity:** Approximately 10<sup>12</sup> lymphocytes in the human body.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="bcells" label="B Cells" default>
*   **Functions:** Primarily produce antibodies.
*   **Antibodies:** Proteins that bind specifically to pathogen-associated molecules (antigens).
*   **Antigen:** A chemical structure on a pathogen surface that binds to B (or T) lymphocyte receptors.
*   **Activation:** Binding to an antigen activates B cells.
*   **Differentiation:** Activated B cells differentiate into **plasma cells**.
*   **Plasma Cells:** Secrete soluble antibodies (the same type as their surface receptors).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tcells" label="T Cells">
*   **Function:** Do *not* secrete antibodies, but perform various adaptive immune response functions.
*   **Mechanisms:**
    *   Secrete soluble factors to communicate with other adaptive immune cells.
    *   Destroy cells infected with intracellular pathogens.
*   **Note:** Roles discussed further in the chapter.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="plasmacells" label="Plasma Cells">
*   **Definition:** B cell that has differentiated in response to antigen binding.
*   **Function:** Gained the ability to secrete soluble antibodies.
*   **Morphology:** Differs from standard B/T cells; contains large cytoplasm packed with rough endoplasmic reticulum (protein synthesis machinery).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nkcells" label="Natural Killer (NK) Cells">
*   **Type:** Fourth important lymphocyte type.
*   **Role:** Participant in the **innate** immune response.
*   **Description:** Circulating blood cell containing cytotoxic (cell-killing) granules.
*   **Mechanism:** Shares cytotoxic mechanism with cytotoxic T cells (adaptive response).
*   **Function:** First line of defense against viruses and certain cancers.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Primary Lymphoid Organs and Lymphocute Development

*   **Importance:** Understanding B and T cell differentiation/development is critical for understanding the adaptive immune response.
*   **Goal of Development:** The body learns to destroy pathogens while leaving self-cells unharmed.
*   **Primary Lymphoid Organs:** Bone marrow and thymus gland.
*   **Function of Primary Organs:** Sites where lymphocytes mature, proliferate, and undergo selection.
*   **Outcome of Selection:** Enables lymphocytes to attack pathogens without harming the body's own cells.

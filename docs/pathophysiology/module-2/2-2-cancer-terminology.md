# 2.2: Cancer Terminology

## Overview
Understanding the language of oncology is crucial. This section defines common terms used to describe abnormal cell growth, tumors, and the spread of cancer.

## Core Definitions
- **Neoplasia/Neoplasm:** "New growth"; an abnormal mass of tissue, the growth of which exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of the normal tissues and persists in the same excessive manner after cessation of the stimuli which evoked the change.
- **Tumor:** A swelling or mass, often used interchangeably with neoplasm.
- **Benign Neoplasm:** A neoplasm that does not invade surrounding tissue or metastasize. Typically well-differentiated and slow-growing. Named using the suffix "-oma" (e.g., fibroma, adenoma).
- **Malignant Neoplasm (Cancer):** A neoplasm capable of invasion (infiltrating surrounding tissues) and metastasis (spreading to distant sites). Often less differentiated and faster-growing.
- **Differentiation:** The degree to which neoplastic cells resemble their normal counterparts, morphologically and functionally.
- **Anaplasia:** Lack of differentiation; a hallmark of malignancy.
- **Dysplasia:** Disordered growth; potentially pre-malignant changes in cells.
- **Metaplasia:** Replacement of one adult cell type with another.

## Types of Malignant Tumors
- **Carcinoma:** Malignant tumor arising from epithelial cells (e.g., adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma). Accounts for the majority of human cancers.
- **Sarcoma:** Malignant tumor arising from mesenchymal tissue (connective tissue, bone, muscle) (e.g., osteosarcoma, liposarcoma).
- **Leukemia:** Cancer arising from hematopoietic (blood-forming) cells in the bone marrow, characterized by large numbers of abnormal white blood cells.
- **Lymphoma:** Cancer arising from lymphocytes or lymph nodes.

## Terms Related to Spread and Progression
- **Invasion:** Direct extension of cancer cells into adjacent tissues.
- **Metastasis:** Spread of cancer cells from the primary site to form secondary tumors at distant sites. Common routes include lymphatic and hematogenous (bloodstream) spread.
- **Staging:** Process of describing the extent or spread of cancer from the site of origin (e.g., TNM system - Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis).
- **Grading:** Assessment of the degree of differentiation and aggressiveness of cancer cells based on microscopic appearance.

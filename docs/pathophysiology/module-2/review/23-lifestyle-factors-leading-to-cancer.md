# List some lifestyle factors that contribute to the development of cancer?

Based on the sources, several **lifestyle factors** are associated with an increased risk of cancer. These factors are often linked to exposure to chemical carcinogens.

*   **Smoking:** Cigarette smoke contains both procarcinogens and promoters, making it a significant lifestyle risk factor. Tobacco use is the cause of about 30% of all cancer deaths and 87% of lung cancer deaths in the United States. Smoking is linked to cancers of the lung, larynx, mouth, esophagus, pancreas, liver, kidney, uterus, and bladder. Chewing tobacco also increases the risk of oral cavity and esophageal cancer. Even secondhand smoke has been classified as a "group A" carcinogen.

*   **Dietary factors:** The chemicals in our diet can also increase the likelihood of cancer.
    *   Carcinogens can be formed when foods are fried in fat that has been reused multiple times.
    *   Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, potent carcinogens, are produced when charcoal-broiling meats and are present in smoked meats and fish.
    *   Nitrosamines, formed in smoked, salted, cured, or pickled foods using nitrites or nitrates, are also dietary carcinogens.
    *   A diet high in fat and red meat and low in dietary fiber has been associated with colon cancer.

*   **Alcohol consumption:** Alcohol is linked to many types of cancer. Its most toxic metabolite, acetaldehyde, can cause point mutations. Alcohol consumption can also enhance the carcinogenic effects of cigarette smoke. Individuals who both smoke and drink considerably have an increased risk of developing cancer of the oral cavity, larynx, and esophagus.

It's important to note that the effects of carcinogenic agents, including those related to lifestyle, are often **dose-dependent**; the greater the exposure (in terms of dose or duration), the higher the risk of cancer. Additionally, it can take a long time, sometimes 5 to 30 years, for cancer to develop following exposure to a carcinogen, making it difficult to always recognize the direct association.

# Why is anemia common in people with cancer?

Based on the sources, **anemia is commonly seen in people with cancer** for several reasons:

*   It can be a **side effect of cancer treatment**.
*   It can occur **because of blood loss**. Cancer can disrupt tissues and erode blood vessels, leading to bleeding.
*   It can be caused by **hemolysis**, the destruction of red blood cells.
*   It can result from **impaired red blood cell production**. Cancer or its treatment can affect the bone marrow, where blood cells are produced. Chemotherapy, for example, can cause a reduction in all three blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) due to bone marrow suppression. Radiation therapy can also suppress bone marrow function if a bone marrow space is within the radiation field.

The source also notes that cancer-related anemia can lead to less effective treatments, increased mortality, increased blood transfusions, and decreased performance and quality of life. It can be treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.

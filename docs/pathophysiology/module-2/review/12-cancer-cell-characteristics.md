# Be familiar with the cancer cell characteristic as summarized in table 2.3.

Based on Table 2.3 in the sources, cancer cells exhibit several key characteristics that distinguish them from normal cells. Here's a breakdown of these characteristics:

*   **Growth:** Normal cells have **regulated growth**, meaning their proliferation is controlled by various signals and mechanisms. In contrast, cancer cells display **unregulated growth**, characterized by excessive and uncontrolled proliferation that is not responsive to normal growth-regulating stimuli. This can be due to genetic abnormalities such as oncogene formation or the loss of function of tumor suppressor genes.

*   **Differentiation:** Normal cells have **high differentiation**, meaning they undergo a process of specialization in both their structure and function, becoming more specialized with each mitotic division. Cancer cells, on the other hand, have **low differentiation** or **anaplasia**, meaning they lose this specialization and have an atypical structure that doesn't resemble the cells of their tissue of origin. Highly anaplastic cells can even resemble undifferentiated or embryonic cells.

*   **Genetic stability:** Normal cells are generally **stable** due to various cellular mechanisms that prevent genetic errors. Cancer cells exhibit **unstable** genetic characteristics, often displaying a high frequency of genetic errors and increased genetic instability. This can include aneuploidy, intrachromosomal instability, microsatellite instability, and point mutations.

*   **Growth factor dependence:** Normal cells are **dependent** on growth factors for proliferation in cell culture, requiring the binding of growth factors to their receptors. Cancer cells show **independence** from growth factors, meaning they can proliferate even in their absence. This can occur because they may produce their own growth factors, have abnormal receptors, or have altered signaling proteins that activate growth pathways within the cell.

*   **Density-dependent inhibition:** Normal cells exhibit **high inhibition** of growth when they reach a certain density and come into contact with each other, a process also known as contact inhibition. Cancer cells have **low inhibition** and grow rampantly without regard for adjacent tissue, continuing to grow even when they come into contact.

*   **Cell-to-cell adhesion:** Normal cells have **high** cohesiveness and adhesion, allowing them to stick together. Cancer cells experience **low** cell cohesiveness and adhesion, which permits surface cells of the tumor to shed into surrounding body fluids or secretions.

*   **Anchorage dependence:** Normal epithelial cells have **high** anchorage dependence, meaning they need to be anchored to neighboring cells or the underlying matrix to survive and grow. If detached, they undergo apoptosis called anoikis. Cancer cells have **low** anchorage dependence and can remain viable and multiply without normal attachments. This is linked to their ability to detach and metastasize.

*   **Cell-to-cell communication:** Normal cells maintain **high** levels of cell-to-cell communication, which is important for intercellular connections and responsiveness to signals. Cancer cells have **low** cell-to-cell communication, which can be due to altered gap junction proteins, for example.

*   **Cell life span:** Normal cells have a **limited** life span and can only divide a finite number of times in culture before becoming senescent. Cancer cells, however, tend to have an **unlimited** life span, achieving immortality by often maintaining high levels of telomerase, an enzyme that prevents telomere shortening, allowing them to continue replicating.

*   **Antigen expression:** Normal cells typically have **absent** or normal antigen expression for their tissue type. Cancer cells **may be present** with altered antigen expression, often reverting to embryonic patterns of gene expression and producing antigens different from the original tissue. These tumor antigens can be useful as identification markers for diagnosis, recurrence, or progressive growth.

*   **Substance production (proteases, hormones):** Normal cells have **normal** production of enzymes and hormones, often producing them in specific amounts or not at all. Cancer cells can exhibit **abnormal** substance production, overcoming normal restrictions and sometimes secreting hormones or enzymes that promote metastasis.

*   **Cytoskeletal composition and arrangement:** Normal cells have **normal** cytoskeletal structures. Cancer cells display **abnormal** cytoskeletal composition and arrangement, including changes in intermediate filaments, actin filaments, and microtubules, which can enhance their ability for invasion and metastasis.

These characteristics collectively contribute to the unregulated growth, invasiveness, and metastatic potential of cancer cells, distinguishing them fundamentally from their normal counterparts. Understanding these differences is crucial for cancer diagnosis, treatment, and research.

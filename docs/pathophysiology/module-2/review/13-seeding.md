# What is seeding?

Based on the sources, **seeding of cancer cells** describes **how shed tumor cells enter circulation and move into similar or different body cavities**.

Here are some key aspects of seeding, according to the sources:

*   **Mechanism:** Cancer cells are shed from the primary tumor and gain access to body cavities.
*   **Common location:** Seeding most often occurs into the **peritoneal cavity**, which is frequently seen with **ovarian cancer**.
*   **Consequences:** If seeding happens in these spaces, **fluid accumulation** typically follows, such as **ascites** (fluid in the peritoneal cavity) or **pleural effusion** (fluid in the pleural space around the lungs).
*   **Post-surgical complication:** Seeding into other areas of the body can also be a **complication following the removal of cancerous cells**. The disturbance of cells during surgery may cause cancerous cells to migrate and spread into new body cavities.

In contrast to metastasis, which involves the spread to distant locations via lymph channels and blood vessels, seeding is described as the movement of shed tumor cells within body cavities.

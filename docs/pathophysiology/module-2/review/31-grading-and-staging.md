# Define grading and staging and be familiar with table 2.5.

Based on the sources, **cancer classification** involves both **grading** and **staging**.

**Grading** is based on the **cellular characteristics of the tumor and the degree of abnormalities present**. It involves the **microscopic examination of cancer cells to determine their level of differentiation**. According to Source 2.3, the cytologic/histologic grading of tumors is based on the degree of differentiation, and the closer the tumor cells resemble comparable normal tissue cells, the lower the grade. Tumors are typically graded on a scale from **I to IV**, where **grade I neoplasms are well-differentiated**, and **grade IV are poorly differentiated/anaplastic**.

**Staging**, on the other hand, is the **assessment of the clinical spread of the disease**. Similar to grading, the staging of cancer is classified as **stages I, II, III, or IV**, with **stage IV being the most widespread**, often to distant parts of the body. Determining the stage of cancer may require surgery to assess tumor size and lymph node involvement.

Source 2.5 also mentions a more sophisticated and detailed staging system called the **TNM system** developed by the **American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)**. This system classifies the disease into stages using three main components, as shown in **Table 2.5**:

*   **T (Tumor)**: This component describes the **size and local spread of the primary tumor**.
*   **N (Nodes)**: This indicates the **involvement of the regional lymph nodes**.
*   **M (Metastasis)**: This refers to the **extent of the metastatic involvement**.

Both grading and staging are used in combination to better characterize and identify the type of cancer cells present in a patient, following established standards within the medical community.

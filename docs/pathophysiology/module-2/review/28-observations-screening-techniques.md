# What body parts do we screen through observation? Palpation? Laboratory tests and procedures?

Based on source, **screening** for early cancer detection is performed through several methods:

*   **Observation** is used to screen the **skin, mouth, and external genitalia**. This involves visually inspecting these areas for any abnormalities such as changes in moles, unusual sores, or other visible signs of cancer.
*   **Palpation** involves physically examining certain body parts by touch. This method is used to screen the **breast, thyroid, rectum and anus, prostate, and lymph nodes**. Healthcare professionals can feel for lumps, changes in size or consistency, or tenderness in these areas.
*   **Laboratory tests and procedures** include methods like the **Pap smear, colonoscopy, and mammography**.
    *   The **Pap smear** is a laboratory test used to detect cancer cells, most commonly for **cervical cancer screening** but can also be used on other bodily secretions.
    *   **Colonoscopy** is a procedure involving endoscopic examination of the **colon**.
    *   **Mammography** is an imaging procedure used for **breast cancer screening**.

Source also mentions a **low dose chest CT scan** as a screening test for **lung cancer** in high-risk individuals (heavy smokers age 50 or older). While not explicitly listed under "laboratory tests and procedures," it falls under diagnostic procedures used for screening.

It's important to note that these are cost-effective tests that have been shown to improve cancer outcomes through early detection. However, not all cancers have effective screening tests available, as mentioned with the example of pancreatic cancer.

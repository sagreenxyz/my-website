# What are the 2 cancer associated genes?

Based on the sources, there are two broad categories of cancer-associated genes: **proto-oncogenes** and **tumor suppressor genes**.

*   **Proto-oncogenes** are normal genes that encode proteins that signal for cell proliferation or regulate apoptosis. When these genes become mutated, they can become **oncogenes**, leading to gene overactivity. An example of a proto-oncogene mentioned in the sources is the **ras gene**, which encodes proteins involved in cell signaling related to cell growth and death. A single point mutation in the *ras* gene can lead to the formation of the *ras* oncogene, often causing increased cell proliferation and is seen in many cancers. Another example is the **myc proto-oncogene**, which can be involved in chromosomal translocation in Burkitt lymphoma, leading to its over-expression. The **HER-2/neu gene** is another example of a gene that, when amplified, leads to increased protein production and cell proliferation, as seen in many breast cancers.

*   **Tumor suppressor genes** encode proteins that inhibit cell growth, repair DNA mistakes, or signal for apoptosis. Loss of function (underactivity) of these genes can lead to unregulated cell growth. An example of a tumor suppressor gene highlighted in the sources is **BRCA1 (breast cancer type 1)**, which is involved in repairing damaged DNA. If this gene is damaged, DNA mistakes are not properly repaired, promoting the growth of faulty (cancerous) cells. Another tumor suppressor gene mentioned is **TP53**, which is associated with lung, breast, and colon cancer. **BRCA2 (breast carcinoma 2)** is another tumor suppressor gene linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

Dysregulation in either proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes can lead to unregulated growths and ultimately cancer.

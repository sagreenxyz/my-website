# What are the 3 possible goals of cancer treatment?

Based on the sources, the goals of cancer treatment methods are classified into three categories: **curative, control, and palliative**.

*   **Curative** treatment aims to **completely eliminate the cancer** from the body.
*   **Control** treatment is implemented when the cancer cannot be cured. The goal is to **stop or slow the growth of the cancer and/or prevent it from spreading**.
*   **Palliative** treatment focuses on **relieving symptoms and improving the quality of life** when a cure is not possible. Surgery, for instance, can be used for palliation to relieve symptoms even when the cancer cannot be removed entirely.

# Define neoplasia and neoplasm

**Neoplasia** is the process by which cancer cells showcase patterns of altered cell differentiation and growth. The term itself means "**new growth**".

The **new growth** itself is referred to as a **neoplasm**. Unlike normal tissue growth which responds with hypertrophy and hyperplasia, a neoplasm's growth lacks normal regulatory controls over cell growth and division. Neoplasms serve no purpose and do not respond to appropriate cellular signaling stimuli.

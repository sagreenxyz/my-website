# What are progenitor cells?

Based on the sources, **progenitor cells**, also referred to as parent cells, are one of the three main groups of somatic cells that proliferate. These cells **continue to divide and reproduce**, contributing to the renewal and repair of tissues. Examples of progenitor cells include those found in **blood, skin, and liver**.

Progenitor cells are **more differentiated than stem cells** but **less differentiated than mature, specialized cells**. When a stem cell divides, one daughter cell retains the characteristics of a stem cell, while the other daughter cell differentiates into a progenitor cell. Progenitor cells have a **limited potential for differentiation** compared to stem cells. While specialized cells that are unable to divide rely on progenitor cells of the same lineage for cell division, these progenitor cells are differentiated enough to give rise to daughter cells of the same lineage but are not as fully specialized as the mature cells they produce. Ultimately, progenitor cells can undergo further differentiation to become terminally differentiated cells.

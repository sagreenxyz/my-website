# Give an example of a hereditary cancer

Based on the sources, **breast cancer** is an example of a hereditary cancer. The sources state that breast cancer is seen more frequently in women whose family members, such as grandmothers, mothers, aunts, or sisters, have also had the disease. Furthermore, the sources highlight two tumor suppressor genes, **BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast carcinoma 1 & 2)**, which are linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer and can be inherited. Carriers of the BRCA mutation have a significantly higher lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. These genes also increase the risk of other cancers, such as prostate, pancreatic, and colon cancer.

The sources also mention **retinoblastoma** and **familial adenomatous polyposis of the colon** as examples of cancers with an autosomal dominant inheritance link, where an inherited mutation in a tumor suppressor gene increases susceptibility.

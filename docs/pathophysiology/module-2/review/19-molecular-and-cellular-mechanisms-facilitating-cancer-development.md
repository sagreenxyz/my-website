# What the 6 molecular and cellular mechanisms that are known to facilitate the development of cancer?

Based on the sources, there are **six molecular and cellular mechanisms** that are known to facilitate the development of cancer:

*   **(1) Defects in DNA repair mechanisms**: If genes responsible for repairing DNA damage are flawed, damage to tumor suppressor genes or even apoptotic genes can go unchecked, potentially leading to cancer. Failure to repair damaged genes can also give rise to proto-oncogenes or other abnormal cellular activities.

*   **(2) Defects in growth factor signaling pathways**: Mutations in genes that control these pathways can lead to unregulated cell growth. Normally, cell proliferation involves a growth factor binding to its receptor, activating it, transferring the signal to the nucleus, initiating DNA transcription, and finally entering the cell cycle. Changes that bypass or incorrectly signal for cell growth can have a significant impact, causing unregulated cell growth and proliferation.

*   **(3) Evasion of apoptosis**: The failure of cancer cells to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) is crucial in cancer development. This can be due to various issues like altered cell survival signaling, overly active Ras proteins, TP53 mutations, downregulation of death receptors, stabilization of mitochondria, inactivation of proapoptotic proteins, or the failure of immune cells to induce death. The loss of normal apoptotic pathways can allow DNA-damaged cells to survive.

*   **(4) Avoidance of cellular senescence**: Cellular senescence is when cells stop dividing in response to DNA damage. Cancer cells often bypass this signaling, leading to unregulated growth. For instance, high levels of the enzyme telomerase, which prevents telomere shortening and promotes continuous cell growth, can also prevent senescence.

*   **(5) Development of sustained angiogenesis**: Even with all the necessary genetic abnormalities, cancer cells need a new blood supply (angiogenesis) to survive and grow. This process involves either an increased production of angiogenic factors or a loss of angiogenic inhibitors. Anti-angiogenesis therapy aims to inhibit this process as a cancer treatment.

*   **(6) Metastasis and invasion**: Multiple genes and pathways are involved in the ability of cancer cells to invade surrounding tissues and spread to distant sites (metastasis). It's suggested that genetic programs normally active in stem cells during embryonic development might become active in cancer stem cells, giving them the ability for anchorage-independent growth, allowing them to detach, cross tissue boundaries, and colonize new tissues.

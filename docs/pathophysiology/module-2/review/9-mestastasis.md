# Explain metastasis and how it occurs

**Metastasis** describes the process when a **secondary tumor develops in a location distant from the primary tumor**. This is a key characteristic of **malignant neoplasms**, which can **spread to other parts of the body**, often through the **circulatory or lymphatic systems**. Benign neoplasms, in contrast, are **not capable of metastasizing** and remain localized.

Here's how metastasis occurs, according to the sources:

*   **Malignant cells gain access to blood and lymph channels** to spread to other areas of the body.
*   **Solid tumors** are initially confined but, as growth continues, **cells detach, invade the surrounding tissue, and enter the blood and lymph systems to spread to other sites**.
*   Metastasis is a **multistep process**:
    *   A **cancer cell is shed from the primary tumor**.
    *   It then **invades the surrounding extracellular matrix**.
    *   The cell **gains access to a blood vessel**.
    *   If the cancerous cells **survive its passage in the bloodstream**, it must then **emerge at a favorable location**.
    *   The cell **invades the surrounding tissue** and **begins to grow**.
    *   Importantly, the new tumor must **establish a blood supply (angiogenesis)** to continue to grow. **Angiogenesis** is the development of new blood vessels within the tumor.

The sources also provide some specific examples of metastatic spread:

*   The **liver** is a common site for the metastatic spread of cancers originating in the **GI tract, spleen, and pancreas** because venous blood from these organs flows through the portal vein to the liver.
*   **Prostate cancer** can spread to **bone**, possibly due to a suitable environment for growth at that distant site.
*   The **first evidence of disease** may be found in the **lymph nodes that drain the tumor area**. The **sentinel node** is the first lymph node to which the primary tumor drains.
*   **Breast cancer spreads by way of the lymph nodes**.

Interestingly, a **secondary tumor usually retains many of the characteristics of the primary tumor**, which can help determine the site of the original cancer. Some tumors metastasize early in the disease process, while others do so later. In some cases, a **metastatic tumor might be found before the primary tumor is detected**.

Finally, the sources mention that **multiple genes and molecular and cellular pathways are involved in invasion and metastasis**. There is also a suggestion that **genetic programs normally present in stem cells during embryonic development may become operative in cancer stem cells**, giving them **anchorage-independent cell growth**, which is important for their ability to detach, cross tissue boundaries, and form new colonies.

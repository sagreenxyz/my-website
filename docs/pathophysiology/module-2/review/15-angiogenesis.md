# What is angiogenesis?

Drawing on the sources, **angiogenesis** is the **development of new blood vessels within a tumor**. This process is crucial for tumor growth because once a tumor reaches a distant site, it must **establish a blood supply (along with growth factors) in order to continue to grow**.

Here's a more detailed breakdown based on the sources:

*   The development of new blood vessels is essential for cancer cells to survive, even if they have all the necessary genetic abnormalities. This new blood supply provides the tumor with necessary nutrients and oxygen, allowing it to continue growing.
*   Angiogenesis is listed as one of the **molecular and cellular mechanisms known to facilitate the development of cancer**.
*   While the specific molecular basis for the "angiogenic switch" is not known, it seems to involve either an **increased production of angiogenic factors or the loss of angiogenic inhibitors**.
*   **Anti-angiogenesis therapy** is recognized as an important type of cancer treatment, often used in combination with conventional chemotherapy. The goal of this therapy is to inhibit the formation of new blood vessels, thereby cutting off the tumor's supply of nutrients and hindering its growth. Monoclonal antibodies like bevacizumab target endothelial growth factor to inhibit blood vessel growth in various cancers.

In essence, angiogenesis is a critical process that enables tumors to grow beyond a certain size and potentially metastasize by ensuring they have an adequate blood supply. Disrupting this process is a key strategy in cancer treatment.

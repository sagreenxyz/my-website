# List the 5 possible treatments for cancer.

Based on the sources, the five possible treatments for cancer are:

*   **Surgery**. Surgery is a multifactorial process used to remove cancer, as well as for diagnosing, staging, and palliation. It is often the first treatment for solid tumors if they are small with well-defined margins.
*   **Radiation therapy**. This can be used as the primary method of treatment or as an adjuvant treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, or both. It can also be used palliatively. Radiation therapy uses high-energy particles or waves to destroy or damage cancer cells by creating free radicals that damage cell structures and DNA.
*   **Chemotherapy**. Chemotherapy is a systemic treatment that uses drugs to reach the tumor site and other distant sites. It is a main treatment for most hematologic and some solid tumors and can be a palliative option. Chemotherapeutic drugs prevent cell growth and replication by halting protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis and inhibiting enzyme production and cell mitosis.
*   **Hormonal therapy**. This consists of drugs designed to disrupt the hormonal environment of cancer cells to deprive them of hormonal signals that stimulate cell division. It is used for cancers responsive to hormones, such as those of the breast, prostate, and endometrium.
*   **Biotherapy**. This uses immunotherapy and biologic response modifiers to change the personâ€™s own immune response to cancer. It includes the use of monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, and adjuvants. Monoclonal antibodies can block pathways central to tumor cell survival and proliferation or be modified to deliver toxins or other cancer drugs.

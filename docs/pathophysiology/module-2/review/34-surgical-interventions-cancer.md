# When is surgery appropriate in the treatment of cancer?

Based on the sources, **surgery is an important tool in cancer treatment and is used in several situations**. Source 2.5 outlines the following scenarios where surgery is appropriate:

*   **To remove cancer**: Surgery is often the **first treatment for solid tumors**. If the tumor is **small with well-defined margins**, it can often be **removed completely**.
*   **For diagnosis**: Surgery can be used to obtain tissue samples for **biopsy**, which is essential for diagnosing the correct cancer and histology.
*   **For staging**: Surgery can be necessary to assess the **tumor size and lymph node involvement**, which are critical components of cancer staging.
*   **For palliation**: Even when a cure is not possible, surgery can be used for **relief of symptoms**. For example, it can be used to treat oncologic emergencies like a GI hemorrhage.
*   **In combination with other treatments**: Surgery can be used **in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy** for certain cancers.
*   **Prophylactically**: In families with a **high risk for developing cancer**, such as prophylactic bilateral mastectomy in women with a strong family history of breast cancer, surgery may be appropriate.

The decision regarding the appropriateness of surgery depends on various factors, including:

*   The **extent of the disease**.
*   The **location** of the tumor.
*   The **structures involved**.
*   The **tumor growth rate and invasiveness**.
*   The **surgical risk to the patient**.
*   The **quality of life the patient will have post-surgery**.

Source 2.3 also mentions that surgical removal of cancer can be challenging because there is often no clear line separating cancerous tissue from normal tissue. Therefore, surgeons often remove margins beyond the tumor, and a pathologist verifies if cancer-free margins are present. If not, it suggests that not all of the tumor was removed.

# List some side effects of chemotherapy drugs.

Based on the sources, **chemotherapy drugs can cause several side effects**. These drugs work by preventing cell growth and replication, and they are especially effective against rapidly dividing cells like cancer cells. However, they can also damage normal tissue in the process.

Some common side effects of chemotherapy drugs include:

*   **Reduction in all three blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) due to bone marrow suppression**. This can lead to:
    *   **Neutropenia**, which increases the **risk for infections**.
    *   **Anemia**, which can cause **fatigue**.
    *   **Thrombocytopenia**, which increases the **risk for bleeding**.
    *   The administration of **hematopoietic growth factors** can be helpful to combat bone marrow suppression.
*   **Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting** are common side effects, and **oral and intravenous antiemetics are very effective** in combating these effects.
*   **Alopecia, or hair loss**, results from the impaired proliferation of hair follicles during treatment. This is usually **temporary**, and hair grows back when treatment is stopped.

It's important to note that chemotherapy is a **systemic treatment**, meaning the drugs reach the tumor site as well as other distant sites in the body.

# List some common symptoms people with cancer have

Based on the sources, people with cancer can experience a variety of symptoms, and these can be quite diverse depending on the type, location, and extent of the cancer. Source 2.5 provides a general overview of potential clinical manifestations, noting that the side effects of cancer treatment can also be significant. Some common symptoms mentioned include:

*   **Tissue disruption:** Cancer can disrupt the integrity of tissues, leading to **bleeding** when blood vessels are compressed or eroded, causing ulceration and necrosis. Bleeding can sometimes be the first sign, as seen in colorectal cancer. Cancer may also present as a **growth or sore that does not heal**.
*   **Fluid accumulation:** Unusual amounts of **fluid** can develop in the pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal spaces as an initial sign of some cancers. For example, **lung, breast, and lymphomas** can present with pleural effusions, leading to chest pain, shortness of breath, or cough. **Ovarian cancer** can cause fluid in the peritoneal cavity, resulting in abdominal discomfort or swelling.
*   **Wasting:** Many cancers are associated with **weight loss and wasting of body fat and muscle tissue**, often accompanied by weakness, anorexia, and anemia. This is known as **cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome** and is more common with solid tumors (except breast cancer). It is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.
*   **Fatigue and sleep disturbances:** **Fatigue** and **sleep disturbances** are frequent side effects of cancer, both due to the disease itself and its treatment. People may feel tired, weak, and lacking energy, and these symptoms can persist even after treatment.
*   **Anemia:** An insufficient level of healthy blood cells (**anemia**) is commonly seen in people with cancer, potentially due to treatment effects, blood loss, hemolysis, or impaired red blood cell production. Anemia can lead to less effective treatments, increased mortality, increased blood transfusions, and decreased performance and quality of life.
*   **Paraneoplastic syndromes:** Cancer can also produce symptoms in sites not directly affected by the disease, termed **paraneoplastic syndromes**. These can be caused by hormones secreted by the cancer cells or can manifest as hematopoietic, neurologic, and dermatologic syndromes. Examples include the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion, Cushing syndrome, and hypercalcemia. These syndromes can sometimes be the first indication of cancer.

It's important to remember that this is a general overview, and the specific symptoms experienced will vary greatly among individuals and cancer types.

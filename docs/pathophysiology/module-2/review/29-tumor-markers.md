# What are tumor markers helpful for?

Based on the sources, **tumor markers** are helpful for several reasons. They can present in two main ways: **as antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells or as substances released from normal cells in response to the presence of a tumor**. Additional markers include hormones and enzymes that become overexpressed because of cancer, or oncofetal malignant neoplasms.

Collectively, these tumor markers are used for:

*   **Establishing prognosis**.
*   **Monitoring treatment**. If a particular marker is associated with a tumor and is high before treatment, successful treatment should lead to a decrease in the levels of this marker, indicating a reduction or elimination of the malignancy.
*   **Detecting recurrent disease**. After a cancer has been eliminated, monitoring the associated marker can help detect if the levels begin to rise again over time, which may indicate a recurrence of the cancer.

A well-known example is **prostate-specific antigen (PSA)**, which becomes elevated in prostate cancer and can be easily screened via a blood test.

However, it's important to note that tumor markers have limitations:

*   Most tumor markers can be elevated under **benign conditions**.
*   Most markers are **not elevated in the early stages of malignancy**.
*   Most tumor markers **lack specificity**, with the exception of the PSA test, which limits their ability to accurately screen or diagnose a tumor.

Therefore, while tumor markers have limitations for initial screening and diagnosis, they become **quite valuable in assessing the response to therapy or the recurrence of cancer** once an association between antigen levels and a specific malignancy has been established.

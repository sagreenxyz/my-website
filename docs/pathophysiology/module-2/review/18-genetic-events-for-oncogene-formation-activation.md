# What are the 3 genetic events that lead to oncogene formation and activation?

Based on the sources, there are three common genetic events that lead to proto-oncogenes becoming cancer-causing **oncogenes** through overactivity:

*   **Point mutation**: This involves a **single nucleotide base change** due to an insertion, deletion, or substitution. The sources provide the example of the **ras gene**. A single point mutation within the *ras* gene can result in the **ras oncogene**, often causing an increase in cell proliferation and is seen in many cancers.

*   **Chromosomal translocation**: This is the **unusual movement or rearrangement of a segment of chromosomal DNA**. Chromosomal translocations are common in **Burkitt lymphoma** and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In Burkitt lymphoma, the **myc proto-oncogene** is translocated from its normal position on chromosome 8 to chromosome 14.

*   **Gene amplification**: This refers to the **unusual increase in the number of copies of a certain gene**. This amplification leads to an **unwanted over-expression of the gene**. As the amount of proteins encoded by the gene drastically increases, the result is often an increase in cell proliferation. The sources mention the **human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2/neu) gene** as an example, which is amplified in many breast cancers and often indicates an aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis.

# Explain what carcinoma in situ is?

Based on the sources, **carcinoma in situ is a localized pre-invasive lesion**. This means that it is a group of abnormal cells that are cancerous in nature (carcinoma refers to a malignant tumor of epithelial tissue origin), but they are **still confined to their original location**.

Here are some key characteristics of carcinoma in situ from the sources:

*   It is considered **pre-invasive**. This implies that the cancerous cells have not yet spread beyond their initial site, specifically mentioning that in breast ductal carcinoma in situ, the cells **have not crossed the basement membrane**. The basement membrane is a layer of tissue that separates a group of cells (like epithelial cells) from the underlying connective tissue. If cancer cells cross this boundary, they have the potential to invade other tissues and metastasize.
*   Carcinoma in situ **can typically be surgically removed or treated, and recurrence is less likely**. This highlights the importance of early detection and treatment at this stage.
*   The source provides examples to illustrate this concept. **Breast ductal carcinoma in situ** is one such example. Another example given is **carcinoma in situ of the cervix**, which is described as **essentially 100% curable**.

In essence, carcinoma in situ represents an early stage of cancer development where the abnormal cells possess malignant characteristics but lack the ability to invade surrounding tissues. This localized nature makes it more amenable to treatment with a higher likelihood of a successful outcome.

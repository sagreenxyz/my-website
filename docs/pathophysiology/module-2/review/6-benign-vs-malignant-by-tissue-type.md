# Know the difference in terminology of benign and malignant tumors according to tissue types. 

Refer to table 2.2.

According to the sources, tumors are typically named by adding the suffix **-oma** to the tissue type from which the **benign** growth originates. For **malignant** tumors, the naming convention is different depending on the tissue of origin.

Here's a breakdown of benign and malignant tumor terminology based on tissue types, as provided in Table 2.2 of source:

*   **Epithelial Tissue:**
    *   **Surface:** Benign tumors are called **Papilloma**. Malignant tumors are called **Squamous cell carcinoma**.
    *   **Glandular:** Benign tumors are called **Adenoma**. Malignant tumors are called **Adenocarcinoma**.

*   **Connective Tissue:**
    *   **Fibrous:** Benign tumors are called **Fibroma**. Malignant tumors are called **Fibrosarcoma**.
    *   **Adipose:** Benign tumors are called **Lipoma**. Malignant tumors are called **Liposarcoma**.

*   **Muscle Tissue:**
    *   **Smooth:** Benign tumors are called **Leiomyoma**. Malignant tumors are called **Leiomyosarcoma**.

*   **Neural Tissue:**
    *   **Nerve cell:** Benign tumors are called **Neuroma**. Malignant tumors are called **Neuroblastoma**.
    *   **Glial cell:** Benign tumors are called **Glioma**. Malignant tumors include **Glioblastoma/astrocytoma**.

*   **Hematologic:** These cancers involve blood and lymph systems and are inherently malignant. Examples include:
    *   **Granulocytic:** **Myelocytic leukemia**.
    *   **Lymphocytic:** **Lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma**.

*   **Endothelial:**
    *   **Blood vessels:** Benign tumors are called **Hemangioma**. Malignant tumors are called **Hemangiosarcoma**.

It's important to note that **carcinoma** is a general term for a malignant tumor of epithelial tissue origin, and **sarcoma** is a general term for a malignant tumor of mesenchymal (multipotent) origin. A **polyp** is a growth projecting from a mucosal surface and can be either benign or malignant. **Carcinoma in situ** refers to a localized pre-invasive lesion.

Therefore, when differentiating between benign and malignant tumors based on tissue type terminology, benign tumors often use the tissue name with the **-oma** suffix, while malignant tumors utilize terms like **carcinoma** (for epithelial tissues) or **sarcoma** (for mesenchymal tissues), often with prefixes indicating the specific cell type or tissue of origin. Hematologic cancers have their own specific nomenclature, often including the term **leukemia** or **lymphoma**.

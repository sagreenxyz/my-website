# What is the most important procedure in diagnosing the correct cancer and histology?

Based on the sources, the most important procedure in diagnosing the correct cancer and histology is **tissue biopsy**. The source explicitly states, "**Tissue biopsy involves the removal of a tissue specimen for microscopic study and is an essential procedure in diagnosing the correct cancer and histology**".

The sources describe various other diagnostic methods, including observation, palpation, laboratory tests like Pap smear, colonoscopy, mammography, blood tests for tumor markers, cytologic studies, endoscopic examinations, ultrasonography, x-ray studies, MRI, CT, and PET scans. However, **tissue biopsy** is highlighted as the essential procedure for definitive diagnosis because it allows for the microscopic examination of the tissue, enabling the identification of abnormal cells and the determination of the cancer's type (histology).

While other techniques like immunohistochemistry can be helpful in further identifying specific antigens and determining the origin of metastatic tumors, and cytologic studies examine cells, the **tissue biopsy** provides the fundamental tissue sample needed for a comprehensive histological analysis, which is crucial for accurate diagnosis.

# What organs do hormones and the development of cancer target?

Based on the sources, **hormones are closely associated with the development of cancer in several organs**. The sources specifically mention the following organs as targets for hormones in the context of cancer development:

*   **Breast:** The sources indicate a strong association between hormones and breast cancer. Increased levels of sex hormones like estrogens can stimulate cell proliferation and increase the chance of malignant transformation in breast tissue. Furthermore, breast cancer is responsive to hormone therapy.
*   **Ovary:** Hormones are also closely linked to the development of ovarian cancer. Additionally, mutations in the *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* genes increase the risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.
*   **Endometrium:** Similar to breast and ovary, endometrial cancer has a strong association with hormonal factors. Increased estrogen levels in obese individuals can increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer is also responsive to hormone therapy.
*   **Prostate:** Hormones play a significant role in prostate cancer development. Increased levels of androgens are mentioned in the context of obesity and increased risk of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is also a target for hormone therapy.

Additionally, source notes that other areas such as **renal (kidney), liver, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers** have recently been treated with hormone therapy, suggesting a role of hormones in these cancers as well, although the link might be less established or a more recent area of therapeutic intervention.

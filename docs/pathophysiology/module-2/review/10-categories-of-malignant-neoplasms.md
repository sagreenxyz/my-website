# What are the two broad categories of malignant neoplasms?

According to the sources, there are **two broad categories of malignant neoplasms**. These are:

*   **Solid tumors:** These are initially confined to a **specific tissue or organ**. As these tumors continue to grow, cells can detach, invade the surrounding tissue, and enter the blood and lymph systems, leading to spread to other sites through a process called **metastasis**.
*   **Hematologic cancers:** These involve cells found in the **blood and lymph systems**. Because the blood and lymph systems circulate throughout the body, these cancers are considered to be **already spread throughout the body**. Examples of hematologic cancers include myelocytic leukemia and lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma.

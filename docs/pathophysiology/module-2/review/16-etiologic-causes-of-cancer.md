# What are the 2 broad etiologic causes of cancer?

Based on the sources, the two broad etiologic causes of cancer are:

1.  **The genetic and molecular mechanisms that transform normal cells into cancer cells**. This category encompasses the internal processes within cells that, when dysregulated, can lead to cancerous development. These mechanisms include gene overactivity (like proto-oncogenes becoming oncogenes through point mutations, chromosomal translocations, or gene amplification) and gene underactivity (loss of function of tumor suppressor genes). Defects in DNA repair mechanisms, growth factor signaling pathways, evasion of apoptosis, avoidance of cellular senescence, development of sustained angiogenesis, and metastasis and invasion are also included within these molecular and cellular mechanisms that facilitate cancer development.

2.  **The external factors such as age, heredity, and environmental agents**. This category includes factors originating outside the cellular level that can contribute to cancer development and progression. These external factors can be further broken down:
    *   **Heredity:** Genetic predispositions inherited from family members can increase the risk of certain cancers, such as mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 linked to breast and ovarian cancer.
    *   **Environmental agents:** These include chemical carcinogens (direct-reacting and indirect-reacting agents found in cigarette smoke, diet, and industrial settings), radiation (ionizing and ultraviolet), and cancer-causing viruses (oncogenic viruses like HPV, EBV, HHV-8, and HBV).
    *   Other risk factors like obesity and hormonal factors are also considered external factors that can influence cancer risk.

It's important to note that the development and progression of cancer often involve a complex interplay between these genetic and molecular mechanisms and the external factors.

# What are the 3 main groups of cells that proliferate?

When considering cell proliferation, human cells fall into two major categories: **gametes (ovum and sperm)** and **somatic (non-reproductive) cells**. Of the various somatic cells that proliferate, they can be divided into three large groups:

1.  **Well-differentiated neurons and cells of skeletal and cardiac muscles** that rarely divide and reproduce.
2.  **Progenitor or parent cells** that continue to divide and reproduce, such as blood, skin, and liver cells.
3.  **Undifferentiated stem cells** that can enter the cell cycle and produce large numbers of progenitor cells if needed.

# What are the 4 oncogenic viruses that can induce cancer?

Based on the sources, there are **four DNA viruses** that have been linked to cancer in humans. These include:

*   **(1) Human papillomavirus (HPV)**. Some types of HPV have been shown to cause skin cancers (squamous cell carcinoma) associated with the regions surrounding the cervix, anus, and genitals. HPV types 16 and 18 are strongly associated with cervical cancer.
*   **(2) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)**. This herpesvirus primarily targets B cells and has been noted to play a role in the pathogenesis of four human cancers: Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal cancer, B-cell lymphomas in immunosuppressed people, and in some cases of Hodgkin lymphoma.
*   **(3) Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)**. HHV-8 is associated with Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a malignancy that develops from the endothelial cells lining small blood vessels. KS most frequently occurs in people who are immunosuppressed, including those with AIDS.
*   **(4) Hepatitis B virus (HBV)**. HBV is the causative agent in the development of hepatitis B, and a significant percentage of infected individuals can progress to chronic liver damage, cirrhosis, and ultimately liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma).

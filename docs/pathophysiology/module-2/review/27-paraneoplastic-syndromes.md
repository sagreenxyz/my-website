# What are paraneoplastic syndromes? Give an example.

Based on the sources, **paraneoplastic syndromes** are symptoms that occur in sites **not directly affected by the cancer**. These manifestations can be caused by **hormones secreted by the cancer cells** or can present as **hematopoietic, neurologic, and dermatologic syndromes**.

Source 2.5 mentions that these syndromes can occasionally be seen with **lung, breast, and hematologic malignancies**. It provides three common endocrine syndromes as examples of paraneoplastic syndromes:

*   **Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion**
*   **Cushing syndrome** due to ectopic ACTH production
*   **Hypercalcemia**

The source also notes that paraneoplastic syndromes **may be the first clue that a person has cancer** and should be investigated appropriately. Treatment involves addressing the underlying cancer and suppressing the mediator causing the syndrome.

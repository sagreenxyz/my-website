# Define proliferation and differentiation

**Proliferation** is defined as a **process of cell division** that is an adaptive mechanism for generating new cells to replace old or when more cells are needed. In the context of normal tissue renewal and repair, proliferation is a carefully regulated process. Proto-oncogenes encode proteins that signal for the cell to proliferate through a tightly regulated process. Normal tissues maintain an equilibrium where the number of new cells produced equals the number of cells dying or being shed. This ensures the structure and function of tissues and organs are maintained. However, neoplasms often exhibit genetic abnormalities leading to **excessive and uncontrolled proliferation** that is not regulated by normal growth-regulating stimuli. Cancer cells demonstrate **abnormal and rapid proliferation**. Cell proliferation increases cell numbers through mitotic cell division. In most cases of cancer, this equilibrium between new and removed cells becomes unregulated and unbalanced. Human cells that proliferate are broadly categorized as gametes (for sexual fusion) and somatic (non-reproductive) cells that form the rest of the body. Among the various proliferating somatic cells, there are well-differentiated cells that rarely divide, progenitor cells that continue to divide and reproduce, and undifferentiated stem cells that can produce large numbers of progenitor cells if needed. Cell reproduction (proliferation) is typically increased when tissue is injured or lost, such as the stimulation of blood-forming cells in the bone marrow after bleeding.

**Differentiation** is the **process by which cells become more specialized** with each mitotic division. This process leads to adult cells with a specific set of characteristics regarding their composition, function, and lifespan. As an example, generalized blood-forming cells in the bone marrow differentiate into specialized adult red blood cells with a specific structure and function. The differentiation of cells into various tissue and organ types is influenced by specific genes and patterns of gene expression, along with chemical and environmental stimuli. The rate of cellular reproduction and differentiation must be precisely controlled in both prenatal and postnatal life to ensure the appropriate numbers and types of cells are formed, and these mechanisms stop when needed. As cells become more specialized through differentiation, they lose the ability to develop the structural and functional characteristics of other cell types, maintaining the integrity of developing organs. While specialized cells may lose the ability to divide, cell populations can rely on progenitor or parent cells of the same lineage that are less differentiated but still capable of division. Stem cells, unlike progenitor cells, remain incompletely differentiated and can divide to produce both more stem cells and cells capable of further differentiation. **Anaplasia** in cancerous tissue is defined by the **loss of cell differentiation**, where cancer cells display morphological changes and resemble undifferentiated or embryonic cells rather than the tissue of origin. Normal cells are characterized by high differentiation, whereas cancer cells typically exhibit low differentiation.

# How does radiation kill cancer cells?

Radiation therapy uses **high-energy particles or waves to destroy or damage cancer cells**. The use of radiation leads to the **creation of free radicals**, which in turn **damage cell structures**. This damage can **interrupt the cell cycle process**, **kill cells**, or **damage the DNA within the cells**.

It's important to note that while radiation injures all proliferating cells within the radiation field, **normal tissue is usually able to recover from the damage more readily than cancerous tissue**.

# 2.4: Etiology

## Overview
Cancer development (carcinogenesis) is a multifactorial process involving genetic predisposition and environmental exposures that lead to the accumulation of mutations and epigenetic alterations in cells.

## Major Categories of Carcinogenic Factors

### 1. Chemical Carcinogens
- Substances that can cause cancer by damaging DNA or altering cellular processes.
- **Examples:**
    - Components of tobacco smoke (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrosamines)
    - Asbestos
    - Aflatoxins (produced by molds)
    - Benzene
    - Certain industrial chemicals

### 2. Physical Carcinogens
- Forms of radiation that can induce DNA damage.
- **Examples:**
    - **Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation:** From sunlight or tanning beds (associated with skin cancers).
    - **Ionizing Radiation:** From X-rays, radon gas, nuclear sources (associated with various cancers, including leukemia).

### 3. Oncogenic Viruses and Microbes
- Infectious agents that can contribute to cancer development.
- **Examples:**
    - **Human Papillomavirus (HPV):** Cervical, anal, oropharyngeal cancers.
    - **Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) & Hepatitis C Virus (HCV):** Hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer).
    - **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV):** Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
    - **Human T-lymphotropic Virus 1 (HTLV-1):** Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.
    - **Helicobacter pylori (bacteria):** Gastric cancer, MALT lymphoma.

### 4. Hereditary Factors
- Inherited mutations in specific genes that increase cancer susceptibility.
- **Examples:**
    - **BRCA1/BRCA2:** Increased risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers.
    - **APC:** Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), increased risk of colorectal cancer.
    - **TP53 (Li-Fraumeni Syndrome):** Increased risk of various cancers (sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia).
    - **Mismatch Repair Genes (Lynch Syndrome):** Increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, and other cancers.

### 5. Lifestyle and Environmental Factors
- Modifiable risk factors related to behavior and environment.
- **Examples:**
    - **Tobacco Use:** Leading preventable cause of cancer death.
    - **Diet:** High intake of red/processed meats, low intake of fruits/vegetables.
    - **Obesity:** Associated with increased risk of several cancers (e.g., breast, colorectal, endometrial).
    - **Alcohol Consumption:** Increased risk of cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, breast, colon.
    - **Physical Inactivity:**
    - **Occupational Exposures:**

### 6. Hormonal Factors
- Prolonged exposure to certain hormones can increase risk.
- **Examples:**
    - Estrogen exposure (related to breast and endometrial cancer).

### 7. Chronic Inflammation
- Persistent inflammation can promote cell proliferation and DNA damage.
- **Examples:**
    - Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer risk.
    - Chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer risk.

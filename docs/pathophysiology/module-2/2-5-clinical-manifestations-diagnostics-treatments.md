# 2.5: Clinical Manifestations, Diagnostics, and Treatments

## Overview
This section covers the clinical presentation of cancer, the methods used for diagnosis and staging, and the primary modalities employed for treatment.

## Clinical Manifestations (Signs and Symptoms)

### Local Effects
- Depend on tumor location, size, and pressure on adjacent structures.
- **Examples:** Pain, palpable mass, obstruction (e.g., bowel obstruction, urinary obstruction), bleeding, pathological fractures.

### Systemic Effects (Constitutional Symptoms)
- Often non-specific and can occur with various cancers.
- **Examples:**
    - **Fatigue:** Persistent, unexplained tiredness.
    - **Anorexia/Cachexia:** Loss of appetite, muscle wasting, significant weight loss.
    - **Fever:** Often low-grade, may be related to infection or tumor itself.
    - **Anemia:** Due to chronic bleeding, bone marrow suppression, or chronic disease.
    - **Hypercoagulability:** Increased risk of blood clots (thrombosis).

### Paraneoplastic Syndromes
- Signs and symptoms occurring at sites distant from the tumor or its metastases, caused by substances released by the tumor (e.g., hormones, cytokines) or by autoimmune responses.
- **Examples:** Cushing syndrome (ACTH production), SIADH (ADH production), hypercalcemia (PTHrP production), Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.

## Diagnostics

### Screening
- Tests performed on asymptomatic individuals to detect cancer early (e.g., mammography, colonoscopy, Pap smear, PSA test).

### Diagnostic Workup (for symptomatic patients or abnormal screening)
- **History and Physical Examination:** Detailed patient history, assessment for signs/symptoms.
- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - Complete Blood Count (CBC)
    - Blood chemistry panels
    - **Tumor Markers:** Substances (often proteins) produced by cancer cells or by the body in response to cancer (e.g., CEA, CA-125, PSA, AFP). *Note: Often lack specificity and sensitivity for diagnosis but can be useful for monitoring.*
- **Imaging Studies:**
    - X-ray
    - Computed Tomography (CT)
    - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
    - Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan
    - Ultrasound
- **Biopsy:** Removal of a tissue sample for microscopic examination (histopathology/cytology). Essential for definitive diagnosis. Types include needle biopsy, incisional biopsy, excisional biopsy.
- **Staging:** Determining the extent of cancer spread. Crucial for treatment planning and prognosis.
    - **TNM System:** Most common system.
        - **T:** Size and/or extent of the primary **T**umor.
        - **N:** Involvement of regional lymph **N**odes.
        - **M:** Presence or absence of distant **M**etastasis.

## Treatments

### Primary Treatment Modalities
- **Surgery:** Physical removal of the tumor. Can be curative for localized cancers. May also be palliative or prophylactic.
- **Radiation Therapy:** Uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Can be external beam or internal (brachytherapy).
- **Chemotherapy:** Uses cytotoxic drugs to kill rapidly dividing cells throughout the body (systemic treatment). Often used in combination regimens.
- **Targeted Therapy:** Drugs that target specific molecules (e.g., proteins, genes) involved in cancer growth and survival. Often less toxic to normal cells than traditional chemotherapy. (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies).
- **Immunotherapy:** Treatments that harness the patient's own immune system to fight cancer (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T-cell therapy).
- **Hormone Therapy:** Blocks or removes hormones to slow or stop the growth of hormone-sensitive cancers (e.g., breast, prostate).

### Other Treatment Approaches
- **Stem Cell Transplant (Bone Marrow Transplant):** Used primarily for hematologic malignancies. Allows for high-dose chemotherapy/radiation.
- **Palliative Care:** Focuses on relieving symptoms and improving quality of life for patients with serious illness, regardless of prognosis. Can be given alongside curative treatment.

# 2.3: Cancer Cell Characteristics

## Overview
Cancer cells exhibit distinct biological capabilities that differentiate them from normal cells and enable tumor growth and dissemination. These are often referred to as the "Hallmarks of Cancer."

## Key Characteristics (Hallmarks of Cancer)

1.  **Sustaining Proliferative Signaling:** Cancer cells acquire the ability to grow and divide without normal external growth signals.
    - *Mechanisms:* Activating mutations in growth factor receptors or downstream signaling pathways (e.g., RAS, RAF).
2.  **Evading Growth Suppressors:** Cancer cells become insensitive to signals that normally inhibit cell division.
    - *Mechanisms:* Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (e.g., RB, p53).
3.  **Resisting Cell Death (Apoptosis):** Cancer cells evade programmed cell death pathways.
    - *Mechanisms:* Overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., BCL-2) or inactivation of pro-apoptotic factors.
4.  **Enabling Replicative Immortality:** Cancer cells overcome the normal limit on the number of cell divisions (senescence) often by maintaining telomere length.
    - *Mechanisms:* Upregulation of telomerase enzyme.
5.  **Inducing Angiogenesis:** Cancer cells stimulate the formation of new blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen for tumor growth.
    - *Mechanisms:* Production of pro-angiogenic factors (e.g., VEGF).
6.  **Activating Invasion and Metastasis:** Cancer cells acquire the ability to invade surrounding tissues and spread to distant sites.
    - *Mechanisms:* Changes in cell adhesion molecules (e.g., E-cadherin), degradation of the extracellular matrix (e.g., MMPs), increased motility.

## Emerging Hallmarks and Enabling Characteristics
- **Deregulating Cellular Energetics:** Altered metabolism (e.g., Warburg effect - aerobic glycolysis).
- **Avoiding Immune Destruction:** Evading surveillance and attack by the immune system.
- **Genome Instability and Mutation:** Increased rate of genetic alterations, driving tumor evolution.
- **Tumor-Promoting Inflammation:** Chronic inflammation can contribute to cancer development and progression.

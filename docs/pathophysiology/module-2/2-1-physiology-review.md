# 2.1: Physiology Review

## Overview
This section revisits essential physiological concepts that form the basis for understanding cancer development and progression. Topics likely include cell cycle regulation, DNA replication and repair, apoptosis, and basic tissue structure.

## Key Concepts

### Cell Cycle Regulation
- Phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, M)
- Checkpoints and regulatory proteins (cyclins, CDKs, p53)
- Importance of controlled cell division

### DNA Replication and Repair
- Mechanisms of DNA replication
- Common types of DNA damage
- DNA repair pathways (e.g., mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair)
- Consequences of unrepaired DNA damage (mutations)

### Apoptosis (Programmed Cell Death)
- Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic pathways
- Key molecular players (caspases)
- Role in removing damaged or unnecessary cells

### Tissue Structure and Function
- Basic tissue types (epithelial, connective, muscle, nervous)
- Cell-cell junctions and cell adhesion
- Extracellular matrix components

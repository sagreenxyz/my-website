2.  Binds hormone receptors.
3.  Helps conduct electrical currents (nerve/muscle cells).
4.  Aids in regulating cell growth and proliferation.

## Cellular Communication
**Question:** Why do cells need to communicate with one another?

**Answer:** In complex organisms, cells communicate to coordinate specialized functions, growth, adaptation to changes, and response to stimuli.

## Cell Signaling Methods
**Question:** Name the 4 types of cell signaling.

**Answer:** Autocrine, paracrine, endocrine, and synaptic signaling.

## Up and Down Regulation
**Question:** Know the process of up and down regulation.

**Answer:** Cells adjust sensitivity to signals by changing receptor numbers. *Down-regulation* decreases receptors when messengers are abundant. *Up-regulation* increases receptors when messengers are scarce.

## Receptor Proteins
**Question:** Understand the 3 types of receptor proteins.

**Answer:** The three main classes of cell surface receptors are: G-protein-linked, ion-channel-linked, and enzyme-linked.

## Membrane Transport
**Question:** Explain diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport.

**Answer:**
* ***Diffusion***: Movement down a concentration gradient (high to low) without energy or help.
* ***Facilitated Diffusion***: Movement down a concentration gradient with the help of a transport protein (no energy used).
* ***Active Transport***: Movement *against* a concentration gradient, requiring energy (ATP).

## Active Transport Pumps
**Question:** What is the most important active transport system and why is it important?

**Answer:** The Sodium-Potassium (Na+/K+)-ATPase pump. It moves Na+ out and K+ into the cell using ATP, crucial for maintaining cell volume and enabling nerve/muscle function.

## Endocytosis
**Question:** Define endocytosis and the 2 processes it encompasses.

**Answer:** *Endocytosis* brings substances into the cell by membrane invagination, forming a vesicle. It includes:
1.  *Pinocytosis* ("cell drinking"): engulfing small fluid/solid particles.
2.  *Phagocytosis* ("cell eating"): engulfing larger particles.

## Ion Channels
**Question:** Why are ion channels necessary?

**Answer:** Charged ions cannot easily cross the lipid membrane; ion channels provide selective pathways for facilitated diffusion.

## Membrane Transport Systems
**Question:** Understand the different types of transport systems.

**Answer:**
* **Passive Transport** (no energy): Diffusion, Facilitated Diffusion, Osmosis.
* **Active Transport** (requires energy):
    * *Primary*: Uses ATP directly.

## Apoptosis
**Question:** What is apoptosis?

**Answer:** *Apoptosis* is programmed cell death, a normal process eliminating cells without causing inflammation.

## Necrosis
**Question:** Know the different types of necrosis.

**Answer:** *Necrosis* is cell death in living tissue due to injury, often causing inflammation. Types include:
*   ***Coagulative Necrosis:*** Tissue architecture is preserved initially after cell death, often seen in hypoxic injury like myocardial infarction. The tissue becomes firm.
*   ***Liquefactive Necrosis:*** Enzymatic digestion of dead cells results in a liquid mass. Common in brain infarcts and bacterial infections (pus formation).
*   ***Caseous Necrosis:*** A combination of coagulative and liquefactive necrosis where dead tissue forms a soft, white, "cheese-like" debris. Characteristic of tuberculosis.
*   ***Gangrenous Necrosis:*** A clinical term, usually referring to necrosis of a limb or large area due to ischemia (dry gangrene, primarily coagulative) which can become infected (wet gangrene, involving liquefactive necrosis).

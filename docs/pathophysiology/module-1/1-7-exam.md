Controls the transport of materials from the outside fluids to within. True

The main structural component is made of proteins. False. The main structural component is made of a lipid bilayer.

Helps with the conduction of electrical currents in nerve and muscle cells. True

Aids in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. True

7. Which of the following are true regarding cell communication? Select all that apply.

Paracrine signaling depends on hormones. False

Neurotransmitters act through synapses. True

Enzyme linked receptors act through an on-off switch. True

Autocrine singaling releases a chemical into the extracellular fluid that affects its own activity. True

8. Which are ytrue of the cell membrane? Select all that apply.

Controls the transport of materials from the outside fluids to within. True

The main structural component is made of proteins. False

Helps with the conduction of electrical currents in nerve and muscle cells. True

Aids in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. True

9. Which of the following do not move across the cell membrane via diffusion? Select all that apply.

Oxygen. True

Glucose. False

Alcohol. True

Carbon dioxide. True

10. Which best describes the definition of etiology?

The study of disease causes. True

The study of disease progression. Pathogenesis

The study of disease populations. Epidemiology

The study of disease resolution. Prognosis or Outcome.

11. A patient complains of a sore throat and headache. What are these examples of?

Symptoms. True

Signs. False

12. Which of the following is true of a test's sensitivity?

It is how likely the same result will occur if repeated. False

If negative, it can safely be assumed that the person does not have a disease. True

It is considered a true-negative result. False

It can only be calculated from people without the disease. False

13. Which of the following is the effect of an illness on one's life?

Incidence. False

Morbidity. True

Prevalence. False

Mortality. False

14. Define secondary prevention and give an example.

Secondary prevention aims to detect and treat disease early, usually whiule the disease is asymptomatic and curable. Some examples include annual Pap smears to detect early cervical cancer, encouraging smoking cessation, checking blood pressure and cholesterol, and colonoscopy screening.

15. Compare and contrast the two types of gangrenous necrosis.

In dry gangrene the affected tissue becomes dry and shrinks, the skin wrinkles, and its color changes to dark brown or black. The spread of dry gangrene is slow. It results from a cut off in arterial blood supply and is a form of coagulation necrosis. In wet gangrene, the affected area is cold, swollen, and pulseless. The skin is moist, black, and under tension. Blebs form on the surface, liquification occurs, and a foul odor is caused by bacterial action. The spread of tissue damage is rapid.

16. Explain what necrosis is and give an example and description of one type of necrosis.

Necrosis refers to cell death in an organ or tissues that is still part of a living person. It often interferes with cell replacement and tissue regeneration. Coagulative necrosis results most often from a sudden cutoff of blood supply to an organ (ischemia), particularly the heart and kidney. Liquefactive necrosis occurs when some of the cells die but their catalytic enzymes are not destroyed. It is comonly seen with brain infarcts or abscesses. Caseous necrosis occurs as part of granulomatous inflammation and is most often associated with tuberculosis.

Gangrenous necrosis most often affects the lower extremities or bowel and is secondary to vascular occlusion. The term gangrene is applied when a considerable mass of tissue undergoes necrosis. In dry gangrene the affected tissue becomes dry and shrinks, the skin wrinkles, and its color changes to dark brown or black. The spread of dry gangrene is slow. It results from a cut off in arterial blood supply and is a form of coagulation necrosis. In wet gangrene, the affected area is cold, swollen, and pulseless. The skin is moist, black, and under tension. Blebs form on the surface, liquifaction occurs, and a foul odor is caused by bacterial action. The spread of tissue damage is rapid.

17. Match the type of cell injury to the cause. Some answers may be used more than once.

Sunburn - Radiation injury

Obesity - Nutritional imbalances

Reactive oxygen species - Free radical injury

Low oxygen to tissues - Hypoxic cell injury

Fractures - Physical agents

OTC drugs - Chemical injury

Hypothermia - Physical agents

Radiation treatment - Radiation inury

Lead toxicity - Chemical injury

Bacteria - Biologic agents


18. List the 4 types of tissue found in the body. Pick 2 and give a description and exampe of each.

Epithelial tissue covers the body's outer surface, lines the inner surfaces, and forms glandular tissue. Epithelial tissue has three distinct surfaces and the basal surface is attached to an underlying basement membrane. It is avascular, meaning without blood vessels. It receives oxygen and nutrients from the capillaries of the connective tissue on which it rests.

Connective tissue or supportive tissue is the most abundant tissue in the body. It connects and binds or supports the various tissues. Its cells produce the extracellular matrix that support and hold tissues together. Connective tissue is divided into two types: connective tissue proper and specialized connective tissue (cartilage, bone, and blood cells). The four types of connective tissue proper are loose (areolar), adipose, reticular, and dense connective tissue.

The function of muscle tissue is to move the skeletal structures, pump blood through the heart, and contract the blood vessels and visceral organs. Muscle tissue can acocmplish this by contraction. The two types of fibers that contract are called thin and thick filaments. Thin filaments are called actin, and the thick filaments are myosin. The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth.

Nervous tissue is distributed throughout the body for communication. It provides the means for controlling body function and for sensing and moving about the environment. The two types of cells are neuron and glial cells. Neurons function in communication. Glial (meaning glue) cells support the neurons.

19. What is the most studied active transport system in the human body?

Sodium-potssium (Na+/K+)-ATPase pump

20. What term means "cell drinking" and engulfs small solid or fluid particles, as seen with proteins and electrolytes?

Pinocytosis

21. Electrical potentials that exist in the cell membrane are called what?

Membrane potentials

22. What is the term that best describes the following process?  A transport protein aiding a lipid insoluble or large molecule across the cell membrane that would otherwise not be able to pass through on its own.

Facilitated diffusion

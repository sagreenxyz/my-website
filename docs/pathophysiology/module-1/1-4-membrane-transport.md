# 1.4: Membrane Transport

## Overview
The plasma membrane controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell. This section details the mechanisms involved in membrane transport.

## Passive Transport (No Energy Required)
- **Simple Diffusion:** Movement down the concentration gradient directly across the membrane.
- **Facilitated Diffusion:** Movement down the concentration gradient via membrane proteins (channels or carriers).
- **Osmosis:** Diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane.

## Active Transport (Requires Energy - ATP)
- **Primary Active Transport:** Directly uses ATP to move substances against their concentration gradient (e.g., Sodium-Potassium pump).
- **Secondary Active Transport:** Uses the concentration gradient established by primary active transport to move another substance against its gradient.

## Bulk Transport (For Large Molecules)
- **Endocytosis:** Bringing substances into the cell.
    - Phagocytosis (cell eating)
    - Pinocytosis (cell drinking)
    - Receptor-mediated endocytosis
- **Exocytosis:** Releasing substances from the cell.

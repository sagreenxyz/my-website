# 1.2: Cell Composition and Function

## Overview
This section covers the basic components of a cell and their respective functions, forming the foundation for understanding cellular pathology.

## Key Components
- **Plasma Membrane:** Outer boundary, regulates passage of substances.
- **Cytoplasm:** Intracellular fluid containing organelles.
- **Nucleus:** Contains genetic material (DNA), controls cell activities.
- **Mitochondria:** Powerhouse of the cell, generates ATP.
- **Ribosomes:** Synthesize proteins.
- **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):** Network involved in protein and lipid synthesis (Rough ER and Smooth ER).
- **Golgi Apparatus:** Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids.
- **Lysosomes:** Contain digestive enzymes.
- **Peroxisomes:** Involved in metabolic processes, including breakdown of fatty acids.
- **Cytoskeleton:** Provides structural support and facilitates movement.

## Basic Functions
- Metabolism
- Transport
- Communication
- Reproduction

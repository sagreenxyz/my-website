# 1.3: Cellular Communication

## Overview
Cells communicate with each other through various signaling mechanisms, essential for coordinating functions in multicellular organisms. Disruptions in communication can lead to disease.

## Types of Signaling
- **Direct Contact:** Gap junctions, cell-to-cell recognition.
- **Local Signaling:**
    - **Paracrine:** Signals act on nearby target cells.
    - **Autocrine:** Signals act on the signaling cell itself.
    - **Synaptic:** Neurotransmitters diffuse across synapses.
- **Long-Distance Signaling:**
    - **Endocrine (Hormonal):** Hormones travel via the bloodstream to target cells throughout the body.

## Signal Transduction Pathways
1.  **Reception:** A signaling molecule binds to a receptor protein.
2.  **Transduction:** The binding triggers a series of steps that relay the signal.
3.  **Response:** The transduced signal triggers a specific cellular activity.

## Receptors
- Cell-surface receptors (e.g., G protein-coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, ion channel receptors)
- Intracellular receptors

# What is a Postganglionic Neuron?

"Postganglionic" is an anatomical term, primarily used in the context of the **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)**, which controls involuntary bodily functions like heart rate, digestion, and glandular secretions.

It refers to the **neuron** whose cell body is located **within an autonomic ganglion** (a collection of nerve cell bodies outside the central nervous system) and whose axon extends **from the ganglion to the target effector organ** (like smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, or glands).

Here's a breakdown of the typical ANS pathway to understand the term better:

1.  **Preganglionic Neuron:**
    * This is the *first* neuron in the chain.
    * Its cell body is located within the central nervous system (CNS) â€“ either in the brainstem or the spinal cord.
    * Its axon travels out of the CNS *to* an autonomic ganglion.
    * "Pre-" means *before* the ganglion.

2.  **Autonomic Ganglion:**
    * This is a cluster of neuron cell bodies located outside the CNS.
    * It acts as a relay station.
    * The axon of the preganglionic neuron synapses (communicates) with the cell body of the postganglionic neuron here.

3.  **Postganglionic Neuron:**
    * This is the *second* neuron in the chain.
    * Its cell body is located *within* the autonomic ganglion.
    * Its axon travels *from* the ganglion to innervate the target organ (e.g., the heart, stomach lining, sweat glands).
    * "Post-" means *after* the ganglion.

**In simple terms:** The signal starts in the CNS, travels along the *preganglionic* neuron to a ganglion, is relayed to the *postganglionic* neuron within the ganglion, and then travels along the *postganglionic* neuron to reach the target organ and cause an effect.

The characteristics (like length and neurotransmitters used) of pre- and postganglionic neurons differ between the two main branches of the ANS:

* **Sympathetic Nervous System (Fight-or-Flight):** Typically has *short* preganglionic fibers and *long* postganglionic fibers. The main postganglionic neurotransmitter is usually norepinephrine (noradrenaline).
* **Parasympathetic Nervous System (Rest-and-Digest):** Typically has *long* preganglionic fibers and *very short* postganglionic fibers (often located within the wall of the target organ). The postganglionic neurotransmitter is acetylcholine (ACh).

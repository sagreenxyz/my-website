## 5.1 Layers of the Skin

This section describes the structure of the skin, which consists of two main layers, the epidermis and the dermis, overlying the hypodermis.

*   **Integumentary System:** Consists of the skin (cutaneous membrane) and its accessory structures (hair, nails, glands).
*   **Skin:** The largest organ of the body.
*   **Epidermis:**
    *   Outermost layer; composed of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.
    *   Avascular (lacks blood vessels).
    *   Consists of four or five distinct layers (strata), depending on location:
        *   **Stratum Basale (Stratum Germinativum):** Deepest layer; single row of actively mitotic stem cells (keratinocytes) that produce new cells. Also contains melanocytes (produce melanin pigment) and Merkel cells (touch receptors). Attached to the dermis.
        *   **Stratum Spinosum:** Several layers thick; cells contain pre-keratin filaments attached to desmosomes, giving them a "spiny" appearance in prepared slides. Contains Langerhans' (dendritic) cells (immune function).
        *   **Stratum Granulosum:** 3-5 layers of flattened keratinocytes; organelles deteriorating. Cytoplasm contains keratohyaline granules (help form keratin) and lamellar granules (contain water-resistant glycolipids). Last layer with living cells.
        *   **Stratum Lucidum:** Thin, translucent band visible only in **thick skin** (palms, soles). Consists of a few rows of flat, dead keratinocytes.
        *   **Stratum Corneum:** Outermost layer; 20-30 cell layers thick. Consists of anucleated, keratinized dead cells (cornified cells). Provides a durable protective barrier against abrasion, penetration, and water loss.
    *   **Cells of the Epidermis:**
        *   **Keratinocytes:** Produce keratin (fibrous protein); most abundant cell type.
        *   **Melanocytes:** Produce melanin; protect against UV damage.
        *   **Dendritic (Langerhans') Cells:** Macrophages; key activators of the immune system.
        *   **Tactile (Merkel) Cells:** Sensory receptors for touch.
*   **Dermis:**
    *   Layer deep to the epidermis; composed mainly of dense irregular connective tissue.
    *   Strong, flexible connective tissue layer containing collagen and elastic fibers.
    *   Vascularized and innervated. Contains hair follicles, oil glands, and sweat glands.
    *   Two layers:
        *   **Papillary Layer:** Superficial layer (about 20% of dermis); areolar connective tissue. Contains dermal papillae (projections indenting the epidermis) which house capillaries, free nerve endings, and Meissner's corpuscles (touch receptors). In thick skin, papillae lie atop dermal ridges, forming epidermal ridges (fingerprints).
        *   **Reticular Layer:** Deeper layer (about 80% of dermis); dense irregular connective tissue. Contains thick bundles of collagen fibers (providing strength) and elastic fibers (providing stretch-recoil). Contains blood vessels, glands, hair follicles, Pacinian corpuscles (pressure receptors). Cleavage lines (tension lines) and flexure lines are found here.
*   **Hypodermis (Superficial Fascia):**
    *   Layer deep to the dermis; **not** considered part of the skin.
    *   Composed primarily of adipose tissue and areolar connective tissue.
    *   Anchors the skin to underlying structures (mostly muscles), allows skin to slide, acts as a shock absorber and insulator, stores fat.
*   **Skin Color:** Determined by three pigments:
    *   **Melanin:** Primary pigment (yellow to reddish-brown to black); produced by melanocytes, amount influenced by genetics and sun exposure. Protects against UV radiation.
    *   **Carotene:** Yellow to orange pigment found in certain plants; accumulates in stratum corneum and hypodermis.
    *   **Hemoglobin:** Pinkish hue of fair skin reflects the crimson color of oxygenated hemoglobin in dermal capillaries.

## 5.2 Accessory Structures of the Skin

This section describes the structures derived from the epidermis that extend down into the dermis: hair, nails, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands.

*   **Hair (Pili):**
    *   **Structure:** Flexible strands produced by hair follicles, consisting largely of dead, keratinized cells.
        *   **Shaft:** Portion projecting above the skin surface.
        *   **Root:** Portion embedded within the skin (in the follicle).
        *   **Layers:** Medulla (central core), Cortex (surrounds medulla), Cuticle (outermost layer).
    *   **Hair Follicle:** Structure extending from the epidermal surface into the dermis, containing the hair root.
        *   **Hair Bulb:** Expanded deep end of the follicle.
        *   **Hair Matrix:** Actively dividing cells in the hair bulb that produce the hair.
        *   **Hair Papilla:** Dermal tissue protrusion into the hair bulb, containing capillaries that supply nutrients.
    *   **Arrector Pili Muscle:** Smooth muscle attached to the follicle; contraction causes hair to stand on end ("goosebumps").
    *   **Function:** Sensory detection (via root hair plexus), protection (scalp from sun/heat loss, nose/ears from particles), insulation (minor in humans).
    *   **Growth Cycle:** Anagen (active growth), Catagen (transition), Telogen (resting).
    *   **Hair Color:** Determined by type and amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the hair matrix.
*   **Nails:**
    *   **Structure:** Scale-like modification of the epidermis on the distal, dorsal surface of fingers and toes. Consist of hard keratin.
        *   **Nail Plate (Body):** Visible attached portion.
        *   **Free Edge:** Distal portion overhanging the fingertip.
        *   **Nail Root:** Proximal portion embedded under the skin.
        *   **Nail Bed:** Epidermis underlying the nail plate.
        *   **Nail Matrix:** Thickened proximal portion of the nail bed responsible for nail growth.
        *   **Lunula:** White, crescent-shaped region at the base of the nail (visible part of matrix).
        *   **Nail Folds:** Skin folds overlapping the nail borders.
        *   **Cuticle (Eponychium):** Proximal nail fold projecting onto the nail body.
    *   **Function:** Protect the distal ends of digits, support fingertips, aid in grasping small objects.
*   **Sweat Glands (Sudoriferous Glands):** Distributed over the entire skin surface except nipples and parts of external genitalia. Two main types:
    *   **Eccrine (Merocrine) Sweat Glands:**
        *   Most numerous type, abundant on palms, soles, forehead.
        *   Simple coiled tubular glands opening directly onto skin surface via pores.
        *   Secrete sweat (99% water, salts, vitamin C, antibodies, metabolic wastes, dermcidin).
        *   Major role in thermoregulation (evaporative cooling).
    *   **Apocrine Sweat Glands:**
        *   Larger than eccrine glands; found mainly in axillary and anogenital areas.
        *   Ducts empty into hair follicles.
        *   Secretion is similar to true sweat but also contains fatty substances and proteins (viscous, milky/yellowish). Odorless until decomposed by bacteria on skin.
        *   Begin functioning at puberty under hormonal influence; role uncertain (possibly sexual scent glands).
        *   Includes modified types: Ceruminous glands (earwax) and Mammary glands (milk).
*   **Sebaceous (Oil) Glands:**
    *   Simple branched alveolar glands found all over the body except thick skin of palms and soles.
    *   Most develop from hair follicles and secrete into the follicle.
    *   Secrete an oily substance called **sebum** via holocrine secretion (cell ruptures).
    *   **Sebum:** Softens and lubricates hair and skin, prevents water loss, has bactericidal properties.
    *   Activated at puberty by hormones. Blockage leads to acne.

## 5.3 Functions of the Integumentary System

This section details the diverse physiological roles performed by the skin and its accessory structures.

*   **Protection:** Acts as a physical, chemical, and biological barrier.
    *   **Physical Barrier:** Protects against mechanical injury (abrasion), water loss (keratin and glycolipids), and UV radiation (melanin).
    *   **Chemical Barrier:** Acid mantle (low pH of skin secretions) inhibits bacterial growth. Sebum contains bactericidal substances.
    *   **Biological Barrier:** Dendritic (Langerhans) cells in the epidermis and macrophages in the dermis activate the immune system.
*   **Sensory Reception:** Contains various sensory receptors (nerve endings) that detect stimuli from the external environment.
    *   **Tactile (Meissner's) Corpuscles & Merkel Cells:** Detect light touch.
    *   **Lamellated (Pacinian) Corpuscles:** Detect deep pressure and vibration.
    *   **Free Nerve Endings:** Detect pain, temperature, and touch.
    *   **Hair Follicle Receptors:** Detect hair movement.
*   **Thermoregulation:** Helps maintain stable internal body temperature through:
    *   **Sweating:** Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface cools the body (regulated by sympathetic nervous system). Eccrine sweat glands are key.
    *   **Blood Flow Regulation:** Dermal blood vessels constrict (vasoconstriction) in cold environments to conserve heat and dilate (vasodilation) in hot environments to release heat.
*   **Metabolic Functions:**
    *   **Vitamin D Synthesis:** Skin synthesizes inactive Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) when exposed to UV radiation. This precursor is then modified by the liver and kidneys into active Vitamin D (calcitriol), essential for calcium absorption.
    *   **Other minor metabolic roles:** e.g., activation of some steroid hormones.
*   **Blood Reservoir:** The extensive network of dermal blood vessels can hold a significant portion (up to 5%) of the body's total blood volume. This blood can be shunted to other organs when needed.
*   **Excretion:** Limited excretion of nitrogenous wastes (ammonia, urea, uric acid), salts, and water occurs through sweat.

## 5.4 Diseases, Disorders, and Injuries of the Integumentary System

This section discusses common conditions affecting the skin, including cancers, infections, allergic reactions, burns, and effects of aging.

*   **Skin Cancer:** Uncontrolled growth of skin cells, often due to UV radiation exposure.
    *   **Basal Cell Carcinoma:** Most common type; arises from basal cells in the stratum basale; rarely metastasizes. Appears as a shiny bump, nodule, or flat scar-like area.
    *   **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** Arises from keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum; can metastasize if not treated. Appears as a firm red nodule, scaly flat lesion, or sore that doesn't heal.
    *   **Melanoma:** Most dangerous type; arises from melanocytes; highly metastatic. Often develops from a mole. Use ABCDE rule for detection (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter > 6mm, Evolving).
*   **Skin Infections and Allergies:**
    *   **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis):** Allergic reaction presenting as dry, itchy patches; may swell, flake, or bleed. Common in children.
    *   **Acne:** Clogging of pores leading to inflammation and infection, often associated with hormonal changes. Affects areas rich in sebaceous glands (face, back).
    *   **Fungal Infections:** Tinea (athlete's foot, ringworm, jock itch).
    *   **Bacterial Infections:** Impetigo, cellulitis.
    *   **Viral Infections:** Warts, herpes simplex.
*   **Burns:** Tissue damage caused by heat, radiation, electricity, or chemicals. Classified by depth:
    *   **First-degree Burn:** Superficial; affects only the epidermis (e.g., mild sunburn). Symptoms: redness, pain. Heals in days.
    *   **Second-degree Burn:** Affects epidermis and part of the dermis. Symptoms: redness, pain, blistering. Heals in weeks, may scar.
    *   **Third-degree Burn:** Full-thickness; destroys epidermis and dermis, extending into subcutaneous tissue. Appears white, red, or black; nerve endings destroyed (less painful initially). Requires skin grafting for healing.
    *   **Fourth-degree Burn:** Extends into underlying muscle and bone.
    *   **Rule of Nines:** Used to estimate the percentage of total body surface area affected by burns in adults, crucial for guiding fluid replacement and treatment decisions. Severe burns lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and risk of infection.
*   **Injuries:**
    *   **Scars:** Collagen-rich tissue formed after wound healing; differs from normal skin structure (fewer accessory structures).
    *   **Keloids:** Overgrowth of scar tissue beyond the original wound boundaries.
    *   **Bedsores (Decubitus Ulcers):** Caused by prolonged pressure on bony prominences, restricting blood flow and causing tissue necrosis.
    *   **Stretch Marks (Striae):** Result from rapid stretching of the dermis (e.g., pregnancy, weight gain), tearing collagen fibers.
*   **Effects of Aging:**
    *   Decreased cell division, metabolic activity, blood circulation.
    *   Thinner epidermis and dermis; reduced elasticity and collagen.
    *   Wrinkling, slower wound healing.
    *   Reduced melanocyte and dendritic cell activity (paler skin, lower immunity).
    *   Reduced sweat and sebum production (dry skin, difficulty regulating temperature).
    *   Thinning hair, graying hair.

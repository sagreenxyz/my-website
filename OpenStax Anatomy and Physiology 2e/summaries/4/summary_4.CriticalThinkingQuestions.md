# Summary: Chapter 4 Critical Thinking Questions

This section presents questions designed to stimulate deeper thought and application of the concepts covered in Chapter 4 regarding tissues. These questions likely require students to:

*   Analyze the relationship between tissue structure and function (e.g., why is simple squamous epithelium ideal for diffusion?).
*   Compare and contrast different tissue types or subtypes (e.g., differentiate between dense regular and dense irregular connective tissue).
*   Predict the consequences of tissue damage or disease (e.g., what happens if basement membranes are compromised?).
*   Apply knowledge of tissues to explain physiological processes or clinical scenarios.
*   Evaluate the roles of different tissues within an organ system.

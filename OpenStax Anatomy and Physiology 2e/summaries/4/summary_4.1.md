# Summary: 4.1 Types of Tissues

This section introduces the concept of tissues as groups of similar cells working together to perform specific functions, and outlines the four primary tissue types that form the fabric of the human body.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Tissue:** A group of structurally and functionally related cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM) that work together to perform common functions.
*   **Histology:** The microscopic study of tissues.
*   **Extracellular Matrix (ECM):** Non-living material surrounding cells in a tissue, composed of ground substance and protein fibers. Varies greatly among tissue types.

## Four Primary Tissue Types:

1.  **Epithelial Tissue (Epithelium):**
    *   **Function:** Covers body surfaces, lines body cavities and hollow organs, forms glands. Functions include protection, secretion, absorption, filtration, excretion, sensory reception.
    *   **Characteristics:** Cells are tightly packed with little ECM; avascular (no blood vessels); high regenerative capacity; supported by connective tissue; has polarity (apical and basal surfaces).
2.  **Connective Tissue:**
    *   **Function:** Supports, protects, binds other tissues together. Most abundant and widely distributed tissue type.
    *   **Characteristics:** Cells are typically scattered within a large amount of ECM; vascularity varies greatly. ECM consists of ground substance and fibers (collagen, elastic, reticular). Includes diverse types like bone, cartilage, blood, adipose, and fibrous connective tissues.
3.  **Muscle Tissue:**
    *   **Function:** Specialized for contraction to produce movement.
    *   **Characteristics:** Cells are elongated (muscle fibers); highly vascularized. Three types:
        *   **Skeletal Muscle:** Attached to bones; voluntary control; striated.
        *   **Cardiac Muscle:** Found in heart wall; involuntary control; striated; intercalated discs.
        *   **Smooth Muscle:** Found in walls of hollow organs; involuntary control; non-striated.
4.  **Nervous Tissue:**
    *   **Function:** Detects stimuli, transmits electrical impulses (nerve signals) throughout the body to control and coordinate body activities. Main component of the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, nerves).
    *   **Characteristics:** Composed of two main cell types:
        *   **Neurons:** Generate and conduct nerve impulses.
        *   **Neuroglia (Glial Cells):** Support, insulate, and protect neurons.

These four primary tissues combine in various ways to form all the organs and structures of the human body.

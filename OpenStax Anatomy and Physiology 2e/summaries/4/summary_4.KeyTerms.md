# Summary: Chapter 4 Key Terms

This section lists important terminology related to the different types of tissues discussed in Chapter 4.

*(Note: The specific terms are derived from the HTML content provided previously. Below is a representation of the types of terms typically found.)*

*   **Adipose Tissue:** Connective tissue consisting mainly of fat cells (adipocytes).
*   **Apical:** The part of a cell or tissue which faces an open space.
*   **Areolar Tissue:** A type of loose connective tissue proper.
*   **Basal Lamina:** A layer of extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells, on which the epithelium sits.
*   **Cartilage:** A type of supportive connective tissue (hyaline, fibrocartilage, elastic).
*   **Collagen Fiber:** Flexible fibrous proteins that give connective tissue tensile strength.
*   **Connective Tissue:** Tissue type characterized by cells dispersed in an extracellular matrix; provides support, connection, and separation.
*   **Ectoderm, Mesoderm, Endoderm:** Embryonic germ layers from which tissues differentiate.
*   **Elastic Fiber:** Fibrous protein within connective tissue that contains a high percentage of the protein elastin that allows the fibers to stretch and return to original size.
*   **Endocrine Gland:** Ductless gland that releases secretions directly into surrounding tissues and fluids.
*   **Epithelial Tissue (Epithelium):** Tissue type that covers exterior surfaces, lines internal cavities and passageways, and forms certain glands.
*   **Exocrine Gland:** Gland whose secretions leave through a duct that opens directly, or indirectly, to the external environment.
*   **Fibroblast:** Most abundant cell type in connective tissue proper, secretes protein fibers and matrix into the extracellular space.
*   **Gap Junction:** Allows cytoplasmic communications to occur between cells.
*   **Goblet Cell:** Unicellular gland found in columnar epithelium that secretes mucous.
*   **Histology:** Microscopic study of tissues.
*   **Matrix:** Extracellular material which is produced by the cells embedded in it, containing ground substance and fibers.
*   **Muscle Tissue:** Tissue type characterized by its ability to contract (skeletal, smooth, cardiac).
*   **Nervous Tissue:** Tissue type capable of sending and receiving electrochemical signals (neurons and neuroglia).
*   **Neuron:** Excitable neural cell that transfers nerve impulses.
*   **Neuroglia (Glial Cells):** Supportive neural cells.
*   **Osteocyte:** Bone cell.
*   **Pseudostratified Columnar Epithelium:** Epithelium that appears layered but consists of a single layer of irregularly shaped cells.
*   **Reticular Fiber:** Fine fibrous protein, made of collagen subunits, which cross-link to form supporting "nets" within connective tissue.
*   **Simple Columnar/Cuboidal/Squamous Epithelium:** Single layer of epithelial cells of respective shapes.
*   **Stratified Columnar/Cuboidal/Squamous Epithelium:** Multiple layers of epithelial cells of respective shapes.
*   **Tight Junction:** Forms an impermeable barrier between cells.
*   **Tissue:** A group of similar cells performing a related function.
*   **Transitional Epithelium:** Stratified epithelium found in the urinary tract, characterized by its ability to stretch.

# Summary: 15.4 Drugs that Affect the Autonomic System

This section discusses how various drugs can influence the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) by mimicking or blocking the actions of its neurotransmitters (ACh and NE) at their respective receptors.

## Mechanisms of Drug Action:

*   Drugs can target:
    *   Neurotransmitter synthesis, storage, or release.
    *   Neurotransmitter binding to receptors (agonist or antagonist).
    *   Neurotransmitter breakdown or reuptake.

## Cholinergic Drugs (Affect ACh):

*   **Nicotinic Agents:**
    *   **Agonists:** Nicotine (stimulates sympathetic effects initially - increased BP; also parasympathetic effects). Effects are complex due to stimulation of *all* nicotinic receptors (ganglia, skeletal muscle, adrenal medulla).
    *   **Antagonists (Ganglionic Blockers):** Block transmission at autonomic ganglia. Rarely used due to widespread effects.
*   **Muscarinic Agents:** Target receptors on parasympathetic effector organs.
    *   **Agonists (Parasympathomimetics):** Mimic ACh effects (e.g., pilocarpine for glaucoma - constricts pupil; bethanechol for urinary retention - stimulates bladder contraction). Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., neostigmine for myasthenia gravis) prolong ACh action at all cholinergic synapses.
    *   **Antagonists (Anticholinergics / Parasympatholytics):** Block ACh effects (e.g., atropine - dilates pupils, increases heart rate, reduces secretions; scopolamine for motion sickness). Side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation.

## Adrenergic Drugs (Affect NE):

*   Target receptors on sympathetic effector organs.
*   **Adrenergic Receptor Agonists (Sympathomimetics):** Mimic NE/epinephrine effects.
    *   **Alpha Agonists:** e.g., phenylephrine (decongestant - constricts nasal blood vessels).
    *   **Beta Agonists:**
        *   β1 Agonists: e.g., dobutamine (increases heart contractility in heart failure).
        *   β2 Agonists: e.g., albuterol (bronchodilator for asthma - relaxes airway smooth muscle).
    *   **Non-selective Agonists:** Epinephrine (used in anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest).
*   **Adrenergic Receptor Antagonists (Sympatholytics):** Block NE/epinephrine effects.
    *   **Alpha Blockers:** e.g., prazosin (treats hypertension - dilates blood vessels).
    *   **Beta Blockers:** Widely used for hypertension, angina, arrhythmias.
        *   Non-selective (block β1 & β2): e.g., propranolol (can cause bronchoconstriction).
        *   Cardioselective (block β1): e.g., metoprolol, atenolol (reduce heart rate and contractility with less effect on airways).

## Other Drugs Affecting ANS:

*   Drugs affecting NE release/reuptake (e.g., amphetamines, cocaine - increase NE effects; some antidepressants).
*   Drugs acting on central ANS control centers (e.g., clonidine - α2 agonist reducing sympathetic outflow).

Understanding the pharmacology of the ANS is crucial for treating various conditions by selectively enhancing or inhibiting sympathetic or parasympathetic activity. The specificity of drugs for receptor subtypes allows for more targeted therapies with fewer side effects.

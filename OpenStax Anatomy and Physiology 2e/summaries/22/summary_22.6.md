# Summary: 22.6 Modifications in Respiratory Functions

This section discusses adjustments the respiratory system makes in response to specific physiological challenges like exercise, high altitude, and diving, as well as developmental aspects.

## Exercise and the Respiratory System:

*   **Increased Demand:** Exercise increases oxygen demand and carbon dioxide production by working muscles.
*   **Respiratory Adjustments:**
    *   **Hyperpnea:** Increased ventilation (deeper and sometimes faster breathing) matches metabolic needs. Not the same as hyperventilation (excessive ventilation leading to low PCO2).
    *   **Mechanism:** Ventilation increases abruptly at exercise onset, followed by a gradual rise, then steady state. Primarily driven by:
        1.  Psychological stimuli (anticipation).
        2.  Simultaneous cortical activation of skeletal muscles and respiratory centers.
        3.  Proprioceptor feedback from moving muscles and joints.
    *   PCO2, PO2, and pH levels remain surprisingly constant during moderate exercise because ventilation is well-matched to metabolic rate. During strenuous exercise, lactic acid buildup can lower pH and stimulate ventilation further (via peripheral chemoreceptors).
*   **Training Effects:** Athletic training can improve respiratory efficiency but doesn't significantly increase vital capacity.

## High Altitude and Acclimatization:

*   **Challenge:** Atmospheric pressure decreases at high altitude, leading to lower partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in inspired air and arterial blood (hypoxia).
*   **Acute Effects:** Headache, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness (Acute Mountain Sickness - AMS). Increased ventilation and heart rate.
*   **Acclimatization (Long-term Adjustments):**
    *   **Increased Ventilation:** Chemoreceptors respond to low PO2, increasing ventilation rate and depth (sustained). This lowers PCO2 initially, causing alkalosis, but kidneys compensate over time by excreting more bicarbonate.
    *   **Increased Erythropoiesis:** Kidneys release erythropoietin (EPO) in response to hypoxia, stimulating red blood cell production. Increases hemoglobin concentration and oxygen-carrying capacity (takes weeks).
    *   **Increased BPG:** Higher levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) in RBCs cause hemoglobin to unload oxygen more readily to tissues.
    *   Increased capillary density and mitochondrial numbers in tissues.

## Diving and Respiratory Effects (Brief Mention - often covered more in physics/physiology):

*   **Challenge:** Increased ambient pressure underwater affects gas volumes and solubility (Boyle's Law, Henry's Law).
*   **Risks:** Decompression sickness ("the bends") if ascending too quickly (dissolved nitrogen forms bubbles in tissues/blood), nitrogen narcosis at depth, oxygen toxicity under high pressure.

## Developmental Aspects:

*   **Fetal Lungs:** Develop throughout gestation but are non-functional for gas exchange until birth. Surfactant production is crucial for lung inflation after birth (typically adequate after ~30-32 weeks).
*   **Birth:** First breath inflates lungs; requires significant effort. Pulmonary circulation established.
*   **Childhood:** Lungs continue to mature; alveoli increase in number until ~8 years old.
*   **Aging:** Respiratory efficiency decreases with age due to factors like chest wall stiffening, loss of elastic recoil, decreased alveolar surface area, reduced respiratory muscle strength. Vital capacity declines. Increased risk of respiratory infections.

The respiratory system demonstrates significant plasticity, adapting ventilation and oxygen transport mechanisms to meet varying demands imposed by exercise, altitude, and developmental changes.

# Summary: 22.1 Organs and Structures of the Respiratory System

This section provides an overview of the organs comprising the respiratory system, dividing them functionally into the conducting and respiratory zones, and describing the structures from the nose to the bronchioles.

## Major Functions of the Respiratory System:

*   Supply the body with oxygen (O2) and dispose of carbon dioxide (CO2).
*   Also involved in olfaction (smell) and speech.

## Functional Zones:

1.  **Conducting Zone:** Passageways that cleanse, humidify, and warm incoming air, directing it to the gas exchange sites. No gas exchange occurs here.
    *   Includes: Nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, terminal bronchioles.
2.  **Respiratory Zone:** Site of actual gas exchange.
    *   Includes: Respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, alveoli (microscopic structures).

## Organs of the Conducting Zone:

*   **Nose and Nasal Cavity:**
    *   *Functions:* Airway for respiration; moistens, warms, filters, cleanses air; resonating chamber for speech; houses olfactory receptors.
    *   *Structures:* External nose, nasal cavity (divided by nasal septum), vestibule (lined with vibrissae/hairs), olfactory mucosa (superior region), respiratory mucosa (pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet cells, seromucous glands), nasal conchae (superior, middle, inferior - increase surface area, create turbulence). Paranasal sinuses lighten skull, warm/moisten air.
*   **Pharynx (Throat):** Connects nasal cavity/mouth to larynx/esophagus. Passageway for food and air.
    *   *Nasopharynx:* Air passageway only. Pseudostratified ciliated epithelium. Contains pharyngeal tonsil (adenoids), openings of pharyngotympanic tubes. Soft palate/uvula close it during swallowing.
    *   *Oropharynx:* Passageway for food and air. Stratified squamous epithelium (protective). Contains palatine and lingual tonsils.
    *   *Laryngopharynx:* Passageway for food and air. Stratified squamous epithelium. Continuous with esophagus posteriorly.
*   **Larynx (Voice Box):** Attaches to hyoid bone, opens into laryngopharynx, continuous with trachea.
    *   *Functions:* Provides patent (open) airway; routes air and food into proper channels (epiglottis); voice production (vocal folds).
    *   *Structure:* Framework of cartilages (thyroid, cricoid, arytenoid, epiglottis, etc.) connected by membranes/ligaments. **Epiglottis** (elastic cartilage) covers laryngeal inlet during swallowing. **Vocal folds (true vocal cords)** vibrate to produce sound; **vestibular folds (false vocal cords)** help close glottis. Glottis = vocal folds + opening. Voice pitch determined by length/tension; loudness by force of air. Lined mostly by pseudostratified ciliated epithelium (stratified squamous over vocal folds).
*   **Trachea (Windpipe):** Extends from larynx into mediastinum, divides into two main bronchi.
    *   *Structure:* Flexible tube supported by C-shaped hyaline cartilage rings (prevent collapse, allow esophageal expansion). Lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet cells (mucociliary escalator traps/moves debris toward pharynx). **Carina** is ridge at bifurcation point; sensitive cough reflex trigger.
*   **Bronchi and Subdivisions (Bronchial Tree):** Air passages undergo ~23 orders of branching.
    *   *Main (Primary) Bronchi:* Left and right, enter hilum of each lung. Right is wider, shorter, more vertical.
    *   *Lobar (Secondary) Bronchi:* Branch from main bronchi; 3 right, 2 left (one for each lobe).
    *   *Segmental (Tertiary) Bronchi:* Branch from lobar bronchi, supply bronchopulmonary segments.
    *   *Bronchioles:* Passages < 1 mm diameter.
    *   *Terminal Bronchioles:* Smallest conducting zone passages (< 0.5 mm).
    *   *Structural Changes:* Cartilage support decreases (rings to plates to none); epithelium thins (pseudostratified -> columnar -> cuboidal); relative amount of smooth muscle increases (allows bronchoconstriction/dilation).

The conducting zone structures form a continuous pathway that conditions and directs air towards the respiratory zone where gas exchange occurs.

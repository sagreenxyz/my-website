# Summary: 22.3 The Process of Breathing

This section explains the mechanical process of pulmonary ventilation (breathing), including pressure relationships, the actions of respiratory muscles, factors influencing ventilation, and respiratory volumes/capacities.

## Pressure Relationships in the Thoracic Cavity:

*   **Atmospheric Pressure (Patm):** Pressure exerted by air surrounding the body (~760 mmHg at sea level). Respiratory pressures are described relative to Patm.
*   **Intrapulmonary Pressure (Ppul):** Pressure within the alveoli. Fluctuates with breathing phases but always eventually equalizes with Patm.
*   **Intrapleural Pressure (Pip):** Pressure within the pleural cavity (space between visceral and parietal pleura). Always negative relative to Ppul (~4 mmHg less, e.g., 756 mmHg). Caused by opposing forces: lungs' tendency to recoil inward vs. chest wall's tendency to expand outward. Negative Pip keeps lungs inflated.
*   **Transpulmonary Pressure:** Difference between Ppul and Pip (Ppul - Pip). Represents the pressure keeping the air spaces of the lungs open. If Pip = Ppul, lungs collapse (pneumothorax).

## Pulmonary Ventilation (Breathing):

*   **Mechanism:** Mechanical process depending on volume changes in the thoracic cavity, leading to pressure changes, causing airflow to equalize pressure (Boyle's Law: P1V1 = P2V2; pressure varies inversely with volume).
*   **Inspiration (Inhalation):** Active process.
    1.  Inspiratory muscles (diaphragm, external intercostals) contract.
    2.  Diaphragm descends; rib cage rises and expands.
    3.  Thoracic cavity volume increases.
    4.  Pip drops further (becomes more negative).
    5.  Lungs are stretched; Ppul drops (~ -1 mmHg relative to Patm).
    6.  Air flows into lungs down its pressure gradient until Ppul = Patm.
    *   *Forced Inspiration:* Accessory muscles (scalenes, sternocleidomastoid, pectoralis minor) further increase thoracic volume.
*   **Expiration (Exhalation):** Passive process at rest.
    1.  Inspiratory muscles relax.
    2.  Diaphragm rises; rib cage descends due to gravity and elastic recoil.
    3.  Thoracic cavity volume decreases.
    4.  Elastic lungs recoil passively; Ppul rises (~ +1 mmHg relative to Patm).
    5.  Air flows out of lungs down its pressure gradient until Ppul = Patm.
    *   *Forced Expiration:* Active process involving contraction of abdominal muscles and internal intercostals, further decreasing thoracic volume.

## Physical Factors Influencing Pulmonary Ventilation:

1.  **Airway Resistance:** Friction/drag in respiratory passageways. Usually insignificant due to large airway diameters initially and huge cross-sectional area in smaller bronchioles. Resistance greatest in medium-sized bronchi. Smooth muscle contraction (bronchoconstriction) increases resistance; relaxation (bronchodilation) decreases it.
2.  **Alveolar Surface Tension:** Attraction of liquid molecules (water lining alveoli) to one another. Tends to collapse alveoli. **Surfactant** (detergent-like complex produced by Type II alveolar cells) reduces surface tension, preventing collapse and reducing the work of breathing. Insufficient surfactant causes Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome (IRDS).
3.  **Lung Compliance:** Measure of the stretchability of the lungs and chest wall. High compliance = easier expansion. Determined by distensibility of lung tissue and alveolar surface tension. Reduced by fibrosis, low surfactant, decreased thoracic cage flexibility.

## Respiratory Volumes and Capacities (Measured by Spirometry):

*   **Volumes:**
    *   **Tidal Volume (TV):** Air moved in/out during normal quiet breathing (~500 ml).
    *   **Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV):** Extra air forcibly inhaled beyond TV (~3100 ml).
    *   **Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV):** Extra air forcibly exhaled beyond TV (~1200 ml).
    *   **Residual Volume (RV):** Air remaining in lungs after forced expiration (~1200 ml); keeps alveoli open.
*   **Capacities (Sums of volumes):**
    *   **Inspiratory Capacity (IC):** Max air inhaled after normal expiration (TV + IRV).
    *   **Functional Residual Capacity (FRC):** Air remaining after normal expiration (ERV + RV).
    *   **Vital Capacity (VC):** Max air expired after max inspiration (TV + IRV + ERV) (~4800 ml).
    *   **Total Lung Capacity (TLC):** Max air contained in lungs (VC + RV) (~6000 ml).
*   **Dead Space:**
    *   **Anatomical Dead Space:** Air in conducting zone (~150 ml), doesn't participate in gas exchange.
    *   **Alveolar Dead Space:** Non-functional alveoli (due to collapse or poor perfusion).
    *   **Total Dead Space:** Anatomical + Alveolar.
*   **Pulmonary Function Tests:** Spirometry measures volumes/capacities. Minute Ventilation (total air flow in/out per minute). Alveolar Ventilation Rate (AVR) (flow of fresh gases in/out of alveoli per minute; better indicator of effective ventilation: AVR = frequency Ã— (TV - dead space)).

Breathing involves muscle contractions changing thoracic volume, which alters pressures (Ppul, Pip) according to Boyle's Law, driving airflow. Airway resistance, surface tension (counteracted by surfactant), and lung compliance affect ventilation efficiency. Respiratory volumes measure lung function.

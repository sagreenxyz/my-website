# Summary: 22.4 Gas Exchange

This section describes the principles governing the exchange of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) across respiratory membranes in the lungs (external respiration) and between blood and tissues (internal respiration).

## Basic Properties of Gases:

*   **Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures:** The total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is the sum of the pressures exerted independently by each gas (its partial pressure). Partial pressure (P) of a gas is directly proportional to its percentage in the mixture. (e.g., PN2 + PO2 + PCO2 + ... = Total Atmospheric Pressure).
*   **Henry's Law:** When a gas is in contact with a liquid, the gas will dissolve in the liquid in proportion to its partial pressure. The amount dissolved also depends on the gas's solubility in the liquid and the temperature. (CO2 is much more soluble in water/plasma than O2).

## Composition of Alveolar Gas:

*   Alveolar air has different partial pressures than atmospheric air due to:
    *   Gas exchange occurring in the lungs (O2 diffuses out, CO2 diffuses in).
    *   Humidification of inspired air (adds water vapor, PH2O ~47 mmHg).
    *   Mixing of newly inspired air with residual air remaining in lungs.
*   **Typical Alveolar Partial Pressures:** PO2 ≈ 104 mmHg; PCO2 ≈ 40 mmHg. These remain relatively constant during normal breathing.

## External Respiration (Pulmonary Gas Exchange):

*   **Definition:** Exchange of O2 and CO2 across the respiratory membrane between alveoli and pulmonary capillary blood.
*   **Driving Force:** Differences in partial pressures. Gases diffuse down their pressure gradients.
    *   **O2 Diffusion:** Alveolar PO2 (~104 mmHg) > Pulmonary capillary PO2 (~40 mmHg). O2 diffuses rapidly from alveoli into blood until equilibrium (~104 mmHg) is reached.
    *   **CO2 Diffusion:** Pulmonary capillary PCO2 (~45 mmHg) > Alveolar PCO2 (~40 mmHg). CO2 diffuses from blood into alveoli until equilibrium (~40 mmHg) is reached.
*   **Factors Influencing External Respiration Efficiency:**
    1.  **Partial Pressure Gradients and Gas Solubilities:** Larger gradient = faster diffusion. CO2 diffuses readily despite smaller gradient due to its high solubility. O2 gradient is steep, ensuring adequate loading.
    2.  **Thickness and Surface Area of Respiratory Membrane:** Membrane is extremely thin (~0.5 µm), facilitating diffusion. Huge surface area (~50-100 m²). Reduced surface area (emphysema) or thickening (fibrosis, edema) impairs gas exchange.
    3.  **Ventilation-Perfusion Coupling:** Matching alveolar ventilation (airflow) with pulmonary blood perfusion (blood flow) for optimal gas exchange.
        *   *If ventilation < perfusion:* Local PO2 decreases, PCO2 increases. Pulmonary arterioles constrict, airways dilate -> redirects blood/air to better-matched areas.
        *   *If ventilation > perfusion:* Local PO2 increases, PCO2 decreases. Pulmonary arterioles dilate, airways constrict -> redirects blood/air.

## Internal Respiration (Tissue Gas Exchange):

*   **Definition:** Exchange of O2 and CO2 between systemic capillary blood and tissue cells.
*   **Driving Force:** Differences in partial pressures (reversed compared to lungs).
    *   **O2 Diffusion:** Systemic capillary PO2 (~100 mmHg) > Tissue cell PO2 (~<40 mmHg). O2 diffuses from blood into tissues.
    *   **CO2 Diffusion:** Tissue cell PCO2 (~>45 mmHg) > Systemic capillary PCO2 (~40 mmHg). CO2 diffuses from tissues into blood.
*   As blood flows through systemic capillaries, PO2 drops and PCO2 rises, reflecting the exchange with tissues.

Gas exchange relies on diffusion driven by partial pressure gradients across thin, extensive respiratory membranes in the lungs and systemic capillaries, influenced by gas solubility and ventilation-perfusion matching.

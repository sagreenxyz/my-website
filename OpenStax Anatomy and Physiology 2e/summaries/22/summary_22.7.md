# Summary: 22.7 Embryonic Development of the Respiratory System

This section outlines the key stages and processes involved in the formation of the respiratory structures during embryonic and fetal development.

## Early Development (Weeks 4-7):

*   **Origin:** Respiratory system structures arise primarily from **endoderm** (lining) and **mesoderm** (cartilage, muscle, connective tissue).
*   **Laryngotracheal Bud:** Begins around week 4 as an outpocketing (diverticulum) from the ventral wall of the foregut (primitive pharynx).
*   **Tracheoesophageal Septum:** The bud elongates inferiorly, and ridges form that fuse to separate it from the foregut, forming the **esophagus** posteriorly and the **trachea** and **lung buds** anteriorly. Incomplete separation can lead to fistulas.
*   **Larynx Formation:** Develops from the cranial end of the laryngotracheal tube and surrounding mesenchyme (cartilages, muscles). Epiglottis develops from hypopharyngeal eminence.
*   **Trachea Formation:** Develops from the laryngotracheal tube inferior to the larynx. Mesoderm forms cartilage rings and muscle.
*   **Bronchial Bud Branching:** The initial lung buds (primary bronchial buds) divide repeatedly, forming secondary (lobar) bronchi (3 right, 2 left), then tertiary (segmental) bronchi, and progressively smaller airways. Mesoderm forms surrounding cartilage and smooth muscle.

## Lung Maturation Stages (Weeks 5 - Birth and Beyond):

1.  **Embryonic Period (Weeks 4-7):** Lung buds form and initial branching into main, lobar, and segmental bronchi occurs.
2.  **Pseudoglandular Period (Weeks 8-16):** Extensive branching continues, forming terminal bronchioles. Resembles a gland histologically. Respiration is *not* possible as respiratory bronchioles and alveoli haven't formed. Capillary network begins to develop. Diaphragm formation completes.
3.  **Canalicular Period (Weeks 16-26):** Terminal bronchioles give rise to respiratory bronchioles, which then develop alveolar ducts. Lung tissue becomes highly vascularized. Lumens of airways enlarge. Type II alveolar cells begin to appear and produce some surfactant towards the end of this period. Respiration *may* be possible by week 24-26, but usually requires intensive care.
4.  **Saccular Period (Weeks 26-36/Birth):** Alveolar ducts terminate in terminal sacs (primitive alveoli). Capillaries establish close contact with the developing alveoli (blood-air barrier forms). Type I and Type II alveolar cells differentiate further. Surfactant production increases significantly, especially after week 30-32. Lungs are generally capable of supporting respiration.
5.  **Alveolar Period (Week 36/Birth - Childhood ~8 years):** Terminal sacs continue to differentiate into mature alveoli. The number of alveoli increases dramatically after birth, from ~20-50 million at birth to ~300-400 million by age 8. Lungs continue to grow and mature.

## Fetal Breathing Movements:

*   Occur before birth (starting around week 10-12).
*   Involve contraction of respiratory muscles, causing aspiration of amniotic fluid into lungs.
*   Essential for normal lung development and conditioning respiratory muscles.

## At Birth:

*   Lungs are fluid-filled. First breath requires strong effort to inflate alveoli, aided by surfactant reducing surface tension. Fluid is absorbed/cleared. Pulmonary circulation increases dramatically.

Development of the respiratory system is a complex process involving budding, branching morphogenesis, and cellular differentiation, culminating in structures capable of gas exchange, with significant maturation occurring late in gestation and postnatally. Surfactant production is critical for viability.

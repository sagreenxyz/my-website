# Summary: 22.5 Transport of Gases

This section explains how oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported between the lungs and body tissues via the bloodstream.

## Oxygen Transport:

*   **Methods:**
    1.  **Dissolved in Plasma:** Only ~1.5% of O2 is transported dissolved in plasma because O2 is poorly soluble in water.
    2.  **Bound to Hemoglobin (Hb):** ~98.5% of O2 is transported bound to the iron atom within the heme group of hemoglobin molecules inside red blood cells (RBCs). Each Hb molecule can bind up to four O2 molecules.
*   **Hemoglobin Saturation:**
    *   **Oxyhemoglobin (HbO2):** Hemoglobin with O2 bound.
    *   **Deoxyhemoglobin (HHb):** Hemoglobin that has released O2.
    *   **Loading/Unloading:** Binding and release of O2 are reversible: HHb + O2 â‡Œ HbO2 + H+
    *   The binding process is cooperative: binding of one O2 molecule increases Hb's affinity for the next O2.
*   **Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve:**
    *   S-shaped curve showing the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) and the percentage of Hb saturated with O2.
    *   **Plateau (High PO2):** In the lungs (PO2 ~100 mmHg), Hb is nearly fully saturated (~98%). Large drops in PO2 still result in high saturation, ensuring adequate O2 loading even if alveolar PO2 decreases moderately.
    *   **Steep Slope (Lower PO2):** In tissues (PO2 ~40 mmHg at rest), Hb saturation drops significantly (~75%), facilitating O2 unloading. During exercise, tissue PO2 drops further, leading to even greater O2 unloading.
*   **Factors Affecting Hb Saturation (Shifting the Curve):** Changes that enhance O2 unloading (shift curve to the right) occur in metabolically active tissues:
    *   **Increased Temperature:** Higher temp decreases Hb affinity for O2.
    *   **Increased PCO2:** CO2 binds to Hb (carbaminohemoglobin) and causes O2 release.
    *   **Increased H+ (Decreased pH) - Bohr Effect:** H+ binds to Hb, altering its structure and decreasing its affinity for O2. CO2 loading contributes to H+ increase via bicarbonate reaction.
    *   **Increased BPG (2,3-bisphosphoglycerate):** Produced by RBCs during glycolysis; binds to Hb and promotes O2 release. Levels increase in response to hypoxia or certain hormones.

## Carbon Dioxide Transport:

*   **Methods:** CO2 is transported from tissues to lungs in three forms:
    1.  **Dissolved in Plasma:** ~7-10%. More soluble than O2 but still limited.
    2.  **Bound to Hemoglobin (Carbaminohemoglobin):** ~20-30%. CO2 binds to amino acids on the globin chains (not the heme group). Binding is favored by low PCO2 and deoxygenated Hb (Haldane Effect).
    3.  **As Bicarbonate Ions (HCO3-) in Plasma:** ~60-70%. Most important method.
        *   CO2 diffuses into RBCs and combines with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), catalyzed rapidly by **carbonic anhydrase**.
        *   H2CO3 quickly dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).
        *   **Chloride Shift:** HCO3- diffuses out of the RBC into the plasma. To maintain electrical balance, chloride ions (Cl-) move from plasma into the RBC.
        *   H+ ions buffered by binding to Hb within the RBC (promotes O2 unloading - Bohr effect).
*   **Haldane Effect:** Deoxygenated Hb has a greater affinity for CO2 and H+ than oxygenated Hb. Therefore, as blood releases O2 in the tissues, its ability to pick up CO2 (as carbaminohemoglobin and by buffering H+ from the bicarbonate reaction) increases. The reverse happens in the lungs: O2 loading facilitates CO2 unloading.
*   **In the Lungs:** All reactions reverse. PCO2 is lower. CO2 unbinds from Hb. HCO3- moves back into RBCs (Cl- moves out), combines with H+ (released from Hb upon O2 binding) to form H2CO3, which is split by carbonic anhydrase into CO2 and water. CO2 diffuses into alveoli.

Oxygen is primarily transported bound to hemoglobin, with unloading facilitated by conditions in active tissues. Carbon dioxide is transported mainly as bicarbonate ions in plasma, a process linked to oxygen transport via the Bohr and Haldane effects.

# Summary: Chapter 1 Key Terms

This section lists important terminology introduced in Chapter 1, covering fundamental concepts of anatomy, physiology, and body organization.

*(Note: The specific terms are derived from the HTML content provided previously. Below is a representation of the types of terms typically found.)*

*   **Anabolism:** Metabolic processes that build complex molecules from simpler ones.
*   **Anatomical Position:** Standard reference posture: standing erect, feet parallel, arms at sides, palms forward.
*   **Anatomy:** The study of the structure of the body.
*   **Catabolism:** Metabolic processes that break down complex molecules into simpler ones.
*   **Cell:** The basic structural and functional unit of life.
*   **Control Center:** Component of a feedback loop that determines the set point and analyzes input.
*   **Development:** Changes an organism undergoes through time, including growth, differentiation, and repair.
*   **Differentiation:** Process by which unspecialized cells become specialized.
*   **Effector:** Component of a feedback loop that causes a response to change the internal environment.
*   **Feedback (Negative/Positive):** Mechanisms for regulating homeostasis. Negative feedback reverses a deviation; positive feedback intensifies it.
*   **Gross Anatomy (Macroscopic Anatomy):** Study of structures visible to the naked eye.
*   **Homeostasis:** Maintenance of a relatively stable internal environment.
*   **Metabolism:** The sum of all chemical reactions occurring in an organism.
*   **Microscopic Anatomy:** Study of structures requiring magnification (cytology, histology).
*   **Organ:** Structure composed of two or more tissue types performing specific functions.
*   **Organ System:** Group of organs working together to perform major functions.
*   **Organism:** A living being.
*   **Physiology:** The study of the function of the body.
*   **Plane (Sagittal, Frontal/Coronal, Transverse):** Imaginary flat surfaces passing through the body.
*   **Receptor (Sensor):** Component of a feedback loop that monitors the environment and detects changes.
*   **Regional Anatomy:** Study of specific body regions.
*   **Responsiveness (Irritability):** Ability of an organism to sense and react to stimuli.
*   **Serous Membrane (Serosa):** Double-layered membrane lining ventral body cavities (pleura, pericardium, peritoneum).
*   **Set Point:** The physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates.
*   **Systemic Anatomy:** Study of the body system by system.
*   **Tissue:** Group of similar cells performing a specific function.
*   **Ventral/Dorsal Body Cavity:** Major body cavities; ventral includes thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities.

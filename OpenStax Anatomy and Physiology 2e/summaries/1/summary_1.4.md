# Summary: 1.4 Requirements for Human Life

This section identifies the essential environmental factors required for human survival. Deprivation of any of these can impair function and potentially lead to death.

## Essential Requirements:

*   **Oxygen:** Crucial for chemical reactions that produce ATP (energy currency). Brain cells are particularly sensitive to oxygen deprivation. Required for cellular respiration.
*   **Nutrients:** Substances in food and beverages essential for energy, building blocks, and regulating chemical reactions.
    *   **Water:** Most critical nutrient; required for numerous metabolic processes, temperature regulation, cushioning, transport.
    *   **Energy-Yielding Nutrients:** Primarily carbohydrates and lipids (fats).
    *   **Body-Building Nutrients:** Primarily proteins (amino acids).
    *   **Micronutrients:** Vitamins and minerals; essential for various chemical reactions and processes.
*   **Narrow Range of Temperature:** Body temperature must be maintained around 37°C (98.6°F) for metabolic enzymes to function optimally. Deviations (hypothermia or hyperthermia) can impair or stop metabolic reactions.
*   **Narrow Range of Atmospheric Pressure:** Pressure exerted by gases in the atmosphere is needed for breathing (pulmonary ventilation). Appropriate pressure is also required to keep blood gases dissolved.

These factors must remain within specific ranges for the body to maintain homeostasis and survive.

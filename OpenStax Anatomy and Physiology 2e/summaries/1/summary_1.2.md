# Summary: 1.2 Structural Organization of the Human Body

This section describes the hierarchical levels of organization within the human body, from the simplest chemical building blocks to the complex organism.

## Levels of Organization (Simplest to Most Complex):

1.  **Chemical Level:** Atoms (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen) combine to form molecules (e.g., water, proteins).
2.  **Cellular Level:** Molecules combine to form organelles within cells. Cells are the smallest independently functioning units of life.
3.  **Tissue Level:** Groups of similar cells with a common function form tissues (e.g., epithelial, connective, muscle, nervous tissue).
4.  **Organ Level:** Two or more different tissue types combine to form an organ with specific functions (e.g., stomach, brain, heart).
5.  **Organ System Level:** Related organs work together to accomplish a major function (e.g., digestive system, nervous system). There are 11 distinct organ systems in the human body.
6.  **Organismal Level:** All organ systems work together to maintain the life and health of the organism (a human being).

Understanding these levels provides a framework for studying anatomy and physiology.

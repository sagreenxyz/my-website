# Summary: 1.1 Overview of Anatomy and Physiology

This section introduces the fundamental disciplines of anatomy and physiology and their relationship.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Anatomy:** The scientific study of the body's structures. Can be studied at macroscopic (gross anatomy) and microscopic levels.
    *   **Gross Anatomy:** Study of structures visible without magnification (e.g., organs, bones).
    *   **Microscopic Anatomy:** Study of structures requiring magnification (cytology - cells, histology - tissues).
    *   **Regional Anatomy:** Study of structures within a specific body region.
    *   **Systemic Anatomy:** Study of structures comprising a discrete body system.
*   **Physiology:** The scientific study of the chemistry and physics of the body's structures and how they function together to support life. Focuses on maintaining **homeostasis**.
*   **Relationship:** Form (anatomy) dictates function (physiology). The specific arrangement and structure of body parts allow them to perform their specific roles. Understanding both is crucial for comprehending the human body.

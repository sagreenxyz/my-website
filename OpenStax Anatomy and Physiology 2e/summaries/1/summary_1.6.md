# Summary: 1.6 Anatomical Terminology

This section introduces the standardized language used in anatomy and medicine to describe body structures and their locations precisely, avoiding ambiguity.

## Key Terminology:

*   **Anatomical Position:** Standard reference point: Body erect, feet slightly apart, palms facing forward, thumbs pointing away from the body. All directional terms refer to the body in this position.
*   **Body Planes:** Flat surfaces used to divide the body or organs for visualization.
    *   **Sagittal Plane:** Divides vertically into right and left parts.
        *   **Midsagittal (Median):** Lies exactly on the midline.
        *   **Parasagittal:** Offset from the midline.
    *   **Frontal (Coronal) Plane:** Divides vertically into anterior (front) and posterior (back) parts.
    *   **Transverse (Horizontal) Plane:** Divides horizontally into superior (upper) and inferior (lower) parts; produces cross-sections.
*   **Directional Terms:** Describe the location of one body part relative to another (usually in pairs of opposites).
    *   **Superior (Cranial) / Inferior (Caudal):** Toward head / Toward tail (feet).
    *   **Anterior (Ventral) / Posterior (Dorsal):** Toward front / Toward back.
    *   **Medial / Lateral:** Toward midline / Away from midline.
    *   **Proximal / Distal:** Closer to origin/trunk / Farther from origin/trunk (used for limbs).
    *   **Superficial (External) / Deep (Internal):** Toward body surface / Away from body surface.
*   **Body Cavities:** Spaces within the body containing internal organs (viscera).
    *   **Dorsal Body Cavity:** Protects nervous system organs.
        *   **Cranial Cavity:** Encloses brain.
        *   **Vertebral (Spinal) Cavity:** Encloses spinal cord.
    *   **Ventral Body Cavity:** Houses viscera; larger; lined by serous membranes. Subdivided by diaphragm:
        *   **Thoracic Cavity:** Superior subdivision. Contains:
            *   **Pleural Cavities (2):** Each surrounds a lung.
            *   **Mediastinum:** Central region containing pericardial cavity, esophagus, trachea.
            *   **Pericardial Cavity:** Encloses heart.
        *   **Abdominopelvic Cavity:** Inferior subdivision. Contains:
            *   **Abdominal Cavity:** Superior part; contains stomach, intestines, spleen, liver, etc.
            *   **Pelvic Cavity:** Inferior part; contains bladder, some reproductive organs, rectum.
*   **Serous Membranes (Serosa):** Thin, double-layered membranes lining ventral body cavities and covering organs. Reduce friction.
    *   **Parietal Serosa:** Lines cavity walls.
    *   **Visceral Serosa:** Covers organ surfaces.
    *   **Serous Fluid:** Lubricating fluid between layers. (Examples: Pericardium, Pleura, Peritoneum).
*   **Abdominopelvic Regions and Quadrants:** Methods for locating organs.
    *   **Quadrants (4):** Right Upper (RUQ), Left Upper (LUQ), Right Lower (RLQ), Left Lower (LLQ). Simpler method.
    *   **Regions (9):** More specific; includes umbilical, epigastric, hypogastric, right/left hypochondriac, right/left lumbar, right/left iliac (inguinal).

Using standardized anatomical terminology ensures clear communication in healthcare and biological sciences.

# Summary: 7.4 The Thoracic Cage

This section describes the structure and function of the thoracic cage (rib cage), a component of the axial skeleton.

*   **Components:** The thoracic cage is formed by:
    *   **Sternum (Breastbone):** Anteriorly.
    *   **Ribs (12 pairs):** Laterally and posteriorly.
    *   **Costal Cartilages:** Connect ribs to the sternum anteriorly.
    *   **Thoracic Vertebrae (T1-T12):** Posteriorly (part of the vertebral column, but articulate with ribs).
*   **Functions:**
    *   Protects thoracic organs (heart, lungs, major blood vessels).
    *   Supports the pectoral girdle and upper limbs.
    *   Provides attachment points for muscles of the back, chest, neck, shoulders, and respiration.
    *   Plays a crucial role in breathing (mechanics of ventilation).
*   **Sternum:**
    *   Flat bone located in the anterior midline of the chest.
    *   Consists of three fused parts:
        *   **Manubrium:** Superior part; articulates with clavicles (clavicular notches) and the first pair of ribs. Features the jugular (suprasternal) notch.
        *   **Body:** Middle and largest part; articulates directly or indirectly with ribs 2-10.
        *   **Xiphoid Process:** Inferior, cartilaginous tip; ossifies later in life. Attachment site for some abdominal muscles.
    *   **Sternal Angle:** Junction between the manubrium and body; located at the level of the second rib articulation, a useful anatomical landmark.
*   **Ribs:**
    *   Twelve pairs forming the lateral walls of the thorax.
    *   Articulate posteriorly with the thoracic vertebrae (T1-T12).
    *   Classified based on their anterior attachment:
        *   **True Ribs (Vertebrosternal Ribs, 1-7):** Attach directly to the sternum via their own costal cartilages.
        *   **False Ribs (8-12):** Do not attach directly to the sternum.
            *   **Vertebrochondral Ribs (8-10):** Attach indirectly to the sternum via the costal cartilage of the rib above them (specifically, rib 7's cartilage).
            *   **Floating Ribs (Vertebral Ribs, 11-12):** Do not attach to the sternum at all; embedded in posterior abdominal wall muscles.
    *   **Typical Rib Structure:** Head (articulates with vertebral bodies), neck, tubercle (articulates with transverse process of vertebra), angle, shaft (body), costal groove (inferior surface, protects intercostal nerve and vessels).
*   **Costal Cartilages:**
    *   Bars of hyaline cartilage connecting the anterior ends of ribs 1-10 to the sternum (directly or indirectly).
    *   Provide flexibility to the thoracic cage.

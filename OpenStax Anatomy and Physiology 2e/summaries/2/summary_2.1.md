# Summary: 2.1 Elements and Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter

This section introduces the fundamental chemical concepts of elements and atoms, which form the basis of all matter, including the human body.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Matter:** Anything that occupies space and has mass. Composed of elements.
*   **Elements:** Unique substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by ordinary chemical means. Each has distinct physical and chemical properties. Represented by chemical symbols (e.g., O for Oxygen, C for Carbon).
    *   **Major Elements in Body:** Oxygen (O), Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N) make up ~96%.
    *   **Lesser Elements:** Calcium (Ca), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Sulfur (S), Sodium (Na), Chlorine (Cl), Magnesium (Mg), Iron (Fe) make up ~3.9%.
    *   **Trace Elements:** Required in minute amounts (e.g., Iodine (I), Fluorine (F)).
*   **Atoms:** The smallest units of an element that retain the properties of that element. Composed of subatomic particles:
    *   **Protons (p+):** Positively charged; located in the nucleus; determine the element's identity (atomic number). Mass = 1 amu.
    *   **Neutrons (n0):** No charge; located in the nucleus; contribute to mass. Mass = 1 amu.
    *   **Electrons (e-):** Negatively charged; orbit the nucleus in electron shells (energy levels); determine chemical bonding behavior. Mass is negligible.
*   **Atomic Number:** Number of protons in the nucleus. Defines the element.
*   **Mass Number:** Total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.
*   **Isotopes:** Atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons (and thus different mass numbers). Some isotopes are radioactive (**radioisotopes**) and decay over time, emitting radiation.
*   **Electron Shells:** Regions around the nucleus where electrons are likely to be found. Each shell holds a specific maximum number of electrons (e.g., 1st shell: 2, 2nd shell: 8, 3rd shell: 18, but stable with 8).
*   **Valence Shell:** The outermost electron shell. Electrons in this shell (**valence electrons**) determine the atom's chemical reactivity and bonding properties. Atoms tend to interact to achieve a stable, filled valence shell (usually 8 electrons - **octet rule**).

Understanding atoms and elements is fundamental to understanding chemical bonds and reactions in the body.

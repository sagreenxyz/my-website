# Summary: Chapter 2 Key Terms

This section lists important terminology related to the chemical basis of life discussed in Chapter 2.

*(Note: The specific terms are derived from the HTML content provided previously. Below is a representation of the types of terms typically found.)*

*   **Acid:** A substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in solution, lowering pH.
*   **Amino Acid:** Monomer unit of proteins, containing an amine group and a carboxyl group.
*   **Atom:** The smallest unit of an element.
*   **ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate):** The primary energy currency of the cell.
*   **Base:** A substance that accepts hydrogen ions (H+) or releases hydroxide ions (OH-) in solution, raising pH.
*   **Buffer:** A solution that resists changes in pH.
*   **Carbohydrate:** Organic molecule group including sugars and starches, providing energy. (Monosaccharide, Disaccharide, Polysaccharide).
*   **Catalyst:** Substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed (e.g., enzyme).
*   **Chemical Bond:** Attractive force linking atoms (Ionic, Covalent, Hydrogen).
*   **Compound:** Substance composed of two or more different elements joined by chemical bonds.
*   **Covalent Bond:** Chemical bond formed by sharing electrons (Polar, Nonpolar).
*   **Decomposition Reaction:** Reaction breaking down a larger molecule into smaller parts (catabolism).
*   **Denaturation:** Loss of a protein's three-dimensional structure, often leading to loss of function.
*   **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):** Nucleic acid storing genetic information.
*   **Electron:** Negatively charged subatomic particle.
*   **Element:** Pure substance consisting of only one type of atom.
*   **Enzyme:** Biological catalyst, typically a protein.
*   **Hydrogen Bond:** Weak attraction between a slightly positive hydrogen atom and a slightly negative atom (often oxygen or nitrogen).
*   **Ion:** An atom or molecule with a net electrical charge due to loss or gain of electrons (Cation: positive, Anion: negative).
*   **Ionic Bond:** Chemical bond formed by the attraction between oppositely charged ions.
*   **Isotope:** Variant of an element with a different number of neutrons.
*   **Lipid:** Group of organic molecules including fats, oils, phospholipids, and steroids; generally hydrophobic.
*   **Molecule:** Two or more atoms joined by chemical bonds.
*   **Monomer:** A small molecule that can join with others to form a polymer.
*   **Neutron:** Uncharged subatomic particle in the nucleus.
*   **Nucleic Acid:** Organic molecule group including DNA and RNA, storing and processing genetic information.
*   **Nucleotide:** Monomer unit of nucleic acids (sugar, phosphate group, nitrogenous base).
*   **pH:** Measure of acidity or alkalinity (concentration of H+ ions).
*   **Phospholipid:** Lipid molecule with a hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails; major component of cell membranes.
*   **Polymer:** Large molecule formed by linking multiple monomers.
*   **Polypeptide:** Chain of amino acids linked by peptide bonds.
*   **Protein:** Polymer of amino acids; performs diverse functions in the body.
*   **Proton:** Positively charged subatomic particle in the nucleus.
*   **RNA (Ribonucleic Acid):** Nucleic acid involved in protein synthesis.
*   **Salt:** Ionic compound that dissociates in water into cations and anions other than H+ and OH-.
*   **Solute:** Substance dissolved in a solvent.
*   **Solution:** Homogeneous mixture of a solute dissolved in a solvent.
*   **Solvent:** Substance that dissolves a solute (e.g., water).
*   **Steroid:** Type of lipid characterized by a four-ring carbon structure (e.g., cholesterol).
*   **Synthesis Reaction:** Reaction combining smaller molecules to form a larger one (anabolism).
*   **Triglyceride:** Lipid composed of glycerol and three fatty acids; energy storage molecule.

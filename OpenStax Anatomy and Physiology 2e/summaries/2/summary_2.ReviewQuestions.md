# Summary: Chapter 2 Review Questions

This section contains review questions designed to test comprehension of the key concepts covered in Chapter 2, focusing on the chemical level of organization relevant to human anatomy and physiology. The questions likely cover topics such as:

*   Basic atomic structure (protons, neutrons, electrons) and elements common in the body.
*   Chemical bonds (ionic, covalent - polar/nonpolar, hydrogen bonds).
*   Chemical reactions (synthesis, decomposition, exchange) and factors affecting reaction rates.
*   Inorganic compounds essential for life, particularly water (properties like polarity, solvent capabilities, high heat capacity) and salts, acids, and bases (pH scale, buffers).
*   Organic compounds: structure and function of carbohydrates (monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides), lipids (triglycerides, phospholipids, steroids), proteins (amino acids, peptide bonds, levels of protein structure, enzymes), and nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, ATP).

# Summary: 2.2 Chemical Bonds

This section describes how atoms interact and link together by forming chemical bonds, resulting in molecules and compounds. Bonding involves interactions between valence electrons.

## Types of Chemical Bonds:

*   **Ionic Bonds:**
    *   Formed by the *transfer* of one or more valence electrons from one atom (metal) to another (nonmetal).
    *   Creates **ions**: charged atoms.
        *   **Cation:** Atom that loses electrons becomes positively charged.
        *   **Anion:** Atom that gains electrons becomes negatively charged.
    *   The bond is the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions.
    *   Compounds formed are called salts (e.g., NaCl - sodium chloride). Often form crystals. Dissociate into ions in water (electrolytes).
*   **Covalent Bonds:**
    *   Formed by the *sharing* of one or more pairs of valence electrons between atoms (usually nonmetals).
    *   Atoms share electrons to achieve stable valence shells.
    *   Forms true **molecules**.
    *   **Nonpolar Covalent Bond:** Electrons are shared *equally* between atoms (occurs when atoms have similar electronegativity, e.g., C-C, C-H, O2). Electrically balanced.
    *   **Polar Covalent Bond:** Electrons are shared *unequally* between atoms (occurs when atoms have different electronegativity, e.g., O-H in water). Results in slight positive (δ+) and negative (δ-) charges on different parts of the molecule (a dipole).
*   **Hydrogen Bonds:**
    *   Weak attractions formed between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an electronegative atom (like O or N) and another nearby electronegative atom.
    *   Not true bonds involving electron sharing/transfer, but rather intermolecular (between molecules) or intramolecular (within large molecules) attractions.
    *   Crucial for properties of water, protein structure (folding), and DNA structure (holding strands together). Individually weak, collectively strong.

Chemical bonds hold atoms together, forming the molecules essential for life's structures and processes.

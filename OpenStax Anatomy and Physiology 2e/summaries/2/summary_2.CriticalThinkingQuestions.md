# Summary: Chapter 2 Critical Thinking Questions

This section presents questions designed to stimulate deeper thought and application of the chemical concepts covered in Chapter 2. These questions likely require students to:

*   Explain the importance of specific chemical properties (e.g., water's polarity) for physiological processes.
*   Analyze the relationship between the structure and function of organic molecules (e.g., how protein structure determines enzyme activity).
*   Predict the outcomes of changes in chemical conditions (e.g., effects of pH changes on proteins).
*   Apply knowledge of chemical reactions to metabolic processes.
*   Compare and contrast different types of chemical bonds or organic molecules.
*   Relate chemical concepts to health and disease (e.g., role of lipids in atherosclerosis).

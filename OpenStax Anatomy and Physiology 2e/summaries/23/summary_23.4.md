# Summary: 23.4 The Stomach

This section describes the anatomy, histology, secretions, and functions of the stomach, a key organ for food storage and initial protein digestion.

## Gross Anatomy:

*   **Location:** Upper left quadrant of the abdomen, inferior to the esophagus and diaphragm. J-shaped.
*   **Regions:**
    *   **Cardia:** Surrounds the cardial orifice where the esophagus enters.
    *   **Fundus:** Dome-shaped region superior and lateral to the cardia.
    *   **Body:** Midportion, largest region.
    *   **Pyloric Part:** Funnel-shaped inferior region, consisting of the pyloric antrum, pyloric canal, and the **pylorus**, which connects to the duodenum via the **pyloric sphincter** (controls stomach emptying).
*   **Curvatures:** Greater curvature (convex lateral surface), Lesser curvature (concave medial surface).
*   **Omenta:** Mesenteries tethering the stomach: Lesser omentum (liver to lesser curvature), Greater omentum (drapes from greater curvature over intestines).
*   **Volume:** Can expand significantly (from ~50 ml to ~4 L). Rugae (longitudinal folds) allow expansion.

## Microscopic Anatomy (Histology):

*   **Wall Layers:** Standard four tunics (mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, serosa), but with modifications.
    *   **Muscularis Externa:** Has an additional inner oblique layer (besides circular and longitudinal layers). Allows churning and mixing actions.
    *   **Mucosa:** Simple columnar epithelium composed entirely of **goblet cells** producing protective alkaline mucus. Dotted with deep **gastric pits** leading into **gastric glands**.
*   **Gastric Glands:** Produce gastric juice. Contain various secretory cells:
    *   **Mucous Neck Cells:** Secrete acidic mucus. Found in upper "neck" region.
    *   **Parietal Cells:** Secrete **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)** (makes stomach contents acidic, pH 1.5-3.5; denatures proteins, activates pepsin, kills bacteria) and **Intrinsic Factor** (required for vitamin B12 absorption in small intestine).
    *   **Chief Cells:** Secrete **Pepsinogen** (inactive precursor of pepsin) and lipases (minor role in fat digestion). Pepsinogen is activated to **pepsin** (protein-digesting enzyme) by HCl and by pepsin itself.
    *   **Enteroendocrine Cells (G cells):** Secrete chemical messengers, notably **Gastrin** (hormone stimulating HCl secretion, motility) and histamine, serotonin, somatostatin.

## Gastric Secretion:

*   **Regulation:** Controlled by neural (vagal nerve) and hormonal (gastrin, histamine) mechanisms. Divided into three phases:
    1.  **Cephalic (Reflex) Phase:** Triggered by sight, smell, taste, thought of food. Vagal stimulation increases gastric secretion before food enters the stomach.
    2.  **Gastric Phase:** Triggered by food entering the stomach (distension, peptides, low acidity). Stimulates gastrin release, leading to significant HCl and pepsinogen secretion. ~2/3 of gastric juice produced here.
    3.  **Intestinal Phase:** Triggered by chyme entering the duodenum. Initially brief stimulation (intestinal gastrin), followed by inhibition (enterogastric reflex, enterogastrones like secretin, CCK) to slow gastric secretion and emptying.
*   **HCl Secretion Mechanism:** Parietal cells pump H+ (from carbonic acid dissociation) into lumen via H+/K+ ATPase (proton pump); Cl- follows H+. Stimulated by ACh, gastrin, histamine.
*   **Mucosal Barrier:** Protects stomach from self-digestion: thick alkaline mucus, tight junctions between epithelial cells, rapid replacement of damaged cells. Breakdown leads to gastritis or ulcers.

## Gastric Motility and Emptying:

*   **Storage:** Stomach stores ingested food.
*   **Mixing:** Peristaltic contractions mix food with gastric juice, creating **chyme**. Most vigorous near pylorus.
*   **Emptying:** Pyloric sphincter allows small amounts of chyme (~3 ml) into duodenum per contraction. Rate depends on duodenal contents (fatty/hypertonic chyme slows emptying via enterogastric reflex and enterogastrones). Typically takes ~4 hours to empty a meal.

The stomach acts as a temporary storage tank where chemical digestion of proteins begins and food is converted into chyme through mechanical and chemical processes, regulated by complex neural and hormonal controls.

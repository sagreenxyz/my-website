# Summary: 23.6 Accessory Organs in Digestion: The Liver, Pancreas, and Gallbladder

This section describes the structure and digestive functions of the key accessory organs—liver, gallbladder, and pancreas—which produce or store secretions essential for chemical digestion in the small intestine.

## The Liver:

*   **Anatomy:** Largest gland in the body, located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. Composed of four lobes (right, left, caudate, quadrate). Functional units are **liver lobules**, hexagonal structures organized around a central vein.
    *   **Hepatocytes:** Liver cells arranged in plates within lobules. Perform metabolic, secretory (bile), and detoxification functions.
    *   **Portal Triad:** Found at each corner of a lobule; contains a branch of the hepatic artery (oxygenated blood), hepatic portal vein (nutrient-rich blood from intestines), and a bile duct.
    *   **Liver Sinusoids:** Leaky capillaries between hepatocyte plates where blood from hepatic artery and portal vein mixes and flows towards the central vein. Contain Kupffer cells (macrophages).
    *   **Bile Canaliculi:** Tiny canals between hepatocytes that collect bile produced by hepatocytes. Bile flows towards bile ducts in portal triads.
*   **Digestive Function:** Production of **bile**.
    *   **Bile Composition:** Alkaline solution containing bile salts, bile pigments (bilirubin), cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and electrolytes.
    *   **Bile Salts:** Cholesterol derivatives that emulsify fats (break large fat globules into smaller ones), increasing surface area for lipase action. Also aid fat and cholesterol absorption. Conserved via enterohepatic circulation (reabsorbed in ileum, returned to liver).
    *   **Bilirubin:** Pigment derived from heme breakdown; waste product excreted in feces (gives feces brown color).
*   **Other Functions:** Metabolism (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins), detoxification, storage (glycogen, vitamins), synthesis of plasma proteins.

## The Gallbladder:

*   **Anatomy:** Thin-walled muscular sac located on the ventral surface of the liver.
*   **Function:** Stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver.
*   **Mechanism:** Bile backs up into the gallbladder via the cystic duct when the hepatopancreatic sphincter is closed. Gallbladder absorbs water and ions to concentrate bile. Contraction (stimulated by CCK) releases bile into the cystic duct, then common bile duct.
*   **Gallstones:** Crystallized cholesterol due to too much cholesterol or too few bile salts. Can obstruct bile flow.

## The Pancreas:

*   **Anatomy:** Gland located retroperitoneally, mostly posterior to the stomach. Has both endocrine and exocrine functions.
*   **Exocrine Function (Digestive):** Produces **pancreatic juice**.
    *   **Acini:** Clusters of secretory acinar cells that produce enzyme-rich component of pancreatic juice.
    *   **Ducts:** Transport pancreatic juice; epithelial cells secrete bicarbonate-rich component. Juice flows via main pancreatic duct (joins bile duct at hepatopancreatic ampulla) into the duodenum.
    *   **Pancreatic Juice Composition:** ~1.2-1.5 L/day. Watery, alkaline solution (pH ~8, high HCO3-) neutralizes acidic chyme. Contains digestive enzymes:
        *   *Amylase:* Digests carbohydrates.
        *   *Lipases:* Digest fats.
        *   *Nucleases:* Digest nucleic acids.
        *   *Proteases (Trypsinogen, Chymotrypsinogen, Procarboxypeptidase):* Secreted in inactive form (zymogens). Activated in duodenum (Enteropeptidase activates trypsinogen to trypsin; trypsin then activates others). Digest proteins.
*   **Endocrine Function:** Pancreatic islets (islets of Langerhans) produce hormones insulin and glucagon, regulating blood sugar.

## Regulation of Bile and Pancreatic Juice Secretion:

*   **Hormonal:** Primarily by **Cholecystokinin (CCK)** and **Secretin**, released by duodenal enteroendocrine cells in response to chyme.
    *   *CCK:* Stimulated by fatty chyme and proteins. Causes gallbladder contraction, relaxation of hepatopancreatic sphincter, stimulates secretion of enzyme-rich pancreatic juice.
    *   *Secretin:* Stimulated by acidic chyme. Stimulates secretion of bicarbonate-rich pancreatic juice and bile production by the liver.
*   **Neural:** Vagal stimulation (parasympathetic) also promotes secretion during cephalic and gastric phases.

The liver produces bile for fat emulsification, the gallbladder stores and concentrates bile, and the pancreas produces enzyme-rich, alkaline pancreatic juice for digesting all major food types. Their secretions are crucial for chemical digestion in the small intestine.

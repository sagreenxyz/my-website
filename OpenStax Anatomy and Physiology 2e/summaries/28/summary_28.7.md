# Summary: 28.7 Patterns of Inheritance

This section explores the basic principles of heredity, explaining how traits are passed from parents to offspring through genes and chromosomes.

## Basic Concepts:

*   **Genetics:** The study of heredity.
*   **Chromosomes:** Structures in the nucleus containing DNA; humans have 23 pairs (22 pairs of autosomes, 1 pair of sex chromosomes - XX or XY).
*   **Genes:** Segments of DNA on chromosomes that code for specific traits.
*   **Alleles:** Alternative forms of a gene (e.g., allele for blue eyes vs. brown eyes). Individuals inherit one allele from each parent for each gene.
*   **Genotype:** The genetic makeup of an individual (the specific alleles they possess, e.g., BB, Bb, bb).
*   **Phenotype:** The observable characteristics or traits expressed by an individual (e.g., brown eyes, blue eyes), resulting from their genotype and environmental influences.
*   **Homozygous:** Having two identical alleles for a trait (e.g., BB or bb).
*   **Heterozygous:** Having two different alleles for a trait (e.g., Bb).
*   **Dominant Allele:** An allele whose trait is expressed even when paired with a different (recessive) allele (represented by uppercase letter, e.g., B for brown eyes).
*   **Recessive Allele:** An allele whose trait is only expressed when paired with another identical recessive allele (represented by lowercase letter, e.g., b for blue eyes).

## Patterns of Inheritance:

*   **Autosomal Dominant:** Trait appears in every generation; affected individuals have at least one affected parent (unless new mutation); affects males and females equally (e.g., Huntington's disease).
*   **Autosomal Recessive:** Trait typically skips generations; affected individuals usually have unaffected parents who are both carriers (heterozygotes); affects males and females equally (e.g., cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia).
*   **Sex-Linked (X-Linked) Inheritance:** Traits determined by genes on the X chromosome.
    *   **X-Linked Recessive:** More common in males (only one X chromosome). Affected males inherit allele from carrier mother; affected females must inherit allele from both parents (e.g., red-green color blindness, hemophilia).
    *   **X-Linked Dominant:** Less common; affected males pass trait to all daughters but no sons; affected heterozygous females pass trait to 50% of offspring.
*   **Incomplete Dominance:** Heterozygote phenotype is intermediate between the two homozygous phenotypes (e.g., sickle cell trait).
*   **Codominance:** Both alleles are fully expressed in the heterozygote phenotype (e.g., AB blood type).
*   **Polygenic Inheritance:** Traits influenced by multiple genes (e.g., height, skin color).
*   **Environmental Influence:** Phenotype is often a result of interaction between genotype and environment.

## Predicting Inheritance:

*   **Punnett Squares:** Diagrams used to predict the probability of offspring inheriting particular genotypes and phenotypes from parents with known genotypes.

Understanding patterns of inheritance helps predict the risk of genetic disorders and explains variation within populations.

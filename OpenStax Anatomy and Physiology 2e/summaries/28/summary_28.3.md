# Summary: 28.3 Fetal Development

This section describes the period of development from the beginning of week 9 until birth (approximately week 38-40), known as the fetal period. It is primarily characterized by growth and maturation of existing organ systems.

## Key Features of the Fetal Period:

*   **Timeframe:** Week 9 post-fertilization to birth.
*   **Focus:** Rapid growth in size and weight, maturation and functional development of tissues and organs established during the embryonic period.
*   **Reduced Sensitivity to Teratogens:** Compared to the embryonic period, but exposure can still cause functional deficits and minor structural abnormalities.

## Major Developmental Milestones (Approximate):

*   **Weeks 9-12:**
    *   Head still dominant, but body length increases.
    *   Facial features become more distinct.
    *   Limbs well-formed, digits develop nails.
    *   Ossification centers appear in bones.
    *   Sex readily distinguishable externally (around week 12).
    *   Blood formation begins in bone marrow.
*   **Weeks 13-16:**
    *   Rapid body growth ("catch-up" with head).
    *   Eyes move anteriorly, ears near final position.
    *   Kidneys attain typical structure.
    *   Most bones are distinct.
*   **Weeks 17-20:**
    *   Fetal movements ("quickening") felt by mother.
    *   Skin covered with vernix caseosa (protective coating) and lanugo (fine hair).
    *   Brown fat forms (heat production).
*   **Weeks 21-30:**
    *   Substantial weight gain.
    *   Eyes open.
    *   Lungs begin producing surfactant (critical for breathing after birth, often insufficient before week 26-28).
    *   Testes begin descent in males.
    *   Viability outside the womb increases significantly (though requires intensive care).
*   **Weeks 31-Birth:**
    *   Continued weight gain (mostly subcutaneous fat).
    *   Further maturation of lungs and nervous system.
    *   Lanugo shed, skin becomes smoother and pinker.
    *   Fetus typically assumes vertex (head-down) position.

## Placenta and Circulation:

*   **Placenta:** Fully functional, facilitating nutrient/gas exchange and waste removal between mother and fetus via umbilical cord. Produces hormones (progesterone, estrogen, etc.) essential for maintaining pregnancy.
*   **Fetal Circulation:** Features shunts (ductus venosus, foramen ovale, ductus arteriosus) to bypass immature liver and lungs. These close shortly after birth.

The fetal period transforms the structurally established embryo into an individual capable of survival outside the uterus.

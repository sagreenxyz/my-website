# Summary: 28.1 Fertilization

This section describes the events leading to and including the fusion of sperm and oocyte to form a zygote, marking the beginning of prenatal development.

## Events Leading to Fertilization:

*   **Sperm Transport:** Millions of sperm are ejaculated into the vagina, but only a few thousand reach the uterine tubes. Uterine contractions, sperm motility, and possibly chemical signals aid transport.
*   **Capacitation:** Sperm must undergo functional changes within the female reproductive tract (over several hours) to become capable of fertilization. This involves destabilization of the acrosomal membrane and increased motility.
*   **Oocyte Viability:** The secondary oocyte is viable for about 12-24 hours after ovulation. Sperm can survive in the female tract for 3-5 days. Intercourse must occur within this window for fertilization.

## Fertilization Process (Typically in Ampulla of Uterine Tube):

1.  **Penetration of Corona Radiata:** Capacitated sperm release enzymes (hyaluronidase) from their acrosome to digest intercellular connections between the granulosa cells surrounding the oocyte.
2.  **Penetration of Zona Pellucida:** Sperm binds to ZP3 receptors on the zona pellucida (glycoprotein layer), triggering the **acrosomal reaction**. Enzymes (e.g., acrosin) are released, digesting a path through the zona pellucida.
3.  **Fusion:** The plasma membrane of a single sperm fuses with the oocyte's plasma membrane.
4.  **Blocks to Polyspermy:** Mechanisms preventing fertilization by more than one sperm:
    *   **Fast Block (Oocyte Membrane Depolarization):** Rapid influx of Na+ depolarizes the oocyte membrane, preventing other sperm from fusing. (Transient).
    *   **Slow Block (Cortical Reaction):** Fusion triggers Ca2+ release within the oocyte, causing cortical granules beneath the membrane to release enzymes (zonal inhibiting proteins, ZIPs). These enzymes harden the zona pellucida and destroy sperm receptors (ZP3), permanently preventing further sperm entry.
5.  **Completion of Meiosis II:** Oocyte completes meiosis II, forming the mature ovum and the second polar body.
6.  **Formation of Zygote:** The sperm and ovum nuclei swell to form pronuclei. Their membranes break down, and the chromosomes combine, forming the diploid zygote.

Fertilization is a complex sequence of events requiring precise timing and interaction between sperm and oocyte, culminating in the formation of a single-celled zygote.

# Summary: 27.2 Anatomy and Physiology of the Ovarian Reproductive System

This section describes the structures and functions of the reproductive organs in individuals assigned female at birth, focusing on egg (oocyte) production, hormonal cycles, and support for potential pregnancy.

## Anatomy:

*   **Ovaries (Gonads):** Paired organs producing oocytes (oogenesis) and hormones (estrogen, progesterone). Contain follicles in various stages of development.
*   **Uterine (Fallopian) Tubes / Oviducts:** Receive ovulated oocyte; usual site of fertilization. Fimbriae sweep oocyte into tube; cilia and peristalsis move it towards uterus.
*   **Uterus:** Muscular organ where a fertilized egg implants and develops. Layers:
    *   **Perimetrium:** Outer serous layer.
    *   **Myometrium:** Thick smooth muscle layer (contracts during labor).
    *   **Endometrium:** Inner mucosal lining; site of implantation. Has two layers:
        *   **Stratum Functionalis:** Shed during menstruation.
        *   **Stratum Basalis:** Permanent layer, regenerates functionalis.
*   **Cervix:** Narrow, inferior part of uterus opening into the vagina.
*   **Vagina:** Muscular tube connecting cervix to exterior; receives penis during intercourse, serves as birth canal and passageway for menstrual flow. Acidic environment inhibits bacterial growth.
*   **External Genitalia (Vulva):** Includes mons pubis, labia majora/minora, clitoris (erectile tissue), vestibule (containing vaginal and urethral openings), vestibular glands (lubrication).
*   **Mammary Glands:** Modified sweat glands producing milk (lactation); development influenced by estrogen and progesterone.

## Physiology:

*   **Oogenesis:** Production of female gametes (ova); begins before birth, pauses in meiosis I, resumes at puberty. One mature ovum typically produced per cycle.
*   **Ovarian Cycle:** Monthly series of events associated with oocyte maturation. Average 28 days.
    *   **Follicular Phase (Days 1-14):** Follicle growth stimulated by FSH; dominant follicle selected; produces estrogen.
    *   **Ovulation (Day 14):** LH surge triggers release of secondary oocyte from dominant follicle.
    *   **Luteal Phase (Days 14-28):** Corpus luteum forms from ruptured follicle; produces progesterone and estrogen. Degenerates if no pregnancy occurs.
*   **Uterine (Menstrual) Cycle:** Monthly changes in endometrium, coordinated with ovarian cycle hormones.
    *   **Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5):** Shedding of stratum functionalis due to drop in estrogen/progesterone.
    *   **Proliferative Phase (Days 6-14):** Rebuilding of stratum functionalis stimulated by rising estrogen.
    *   **Secretory Phase (Days 15-28):** Endometrium prepares for implantation, stimulated by progesterone; glands secrete nutrients.
*   **Hormonal Regulation:** Complex interplay involving GnRH, FSH, LH, estrogen, and progesterone, with both negative and positive feedback loops.

The system operates cyclically to prepare for potential fertilization and pregnancy, governed by fluctuating hormone levels.

# Summary: 9.4 Synovial Joints

This section focuses on synovial joints, which are the most common type of joint in the body and allow for free movement (diarthroses).

## Defining Features of Synovial Joints:

All synovial joints share these structural characteristics:

1.  **Articular Cartilage:** Hyaline cartilage covering the opposing bone surfaces. Absorbs compression and provides a smooth, friction-reducing surface.
2.  **Joint (Articular) Cavity:** A space between the articulating bones, filled with synovial fluid. Unique to synovial joints.
3.  **Articular Capsule:** A two-layered enclosure surrounding the joint cavity.
    *   **Fibrous Layer (Outer):** Dense irregular connective tissue, continuous with the periosteum of bones. Strengthens the joint.
    *   **Synovial Membrane (Inner):** Loose connective tissue lining the fibrous layer internally (except over articular cartilage). Produces synovial fluid.
4.  **Synovial Fluid:** Viscous, slippery fluid filling the joint cavity. Derived from filtration of blood plasma and secretions from synovial membrane cells (containing hyaluronic acid). Functions:
    *   **Lubrication:** Reduces friction between articular cartilages.
    *   **Nutrient Distribution:** Provides oxygen and nutrients to, and removes waste from, the avascular articular cartilage (via weeping lubrication).
    *   **Shock Absorption:** Distributes stress across the joint.
5.  **Reinforcing Ligaments:** Bands of dense regular connective tissue connecting bones, strengthening and stabilizing the joint. Can be:
    *   **Capsular (Intrinsic):** Thickened parts of the fibrous layer.
    *   **Extracapsular:** Outside the capsule.
    *   **Intracapsular:** Deep to the capsule (but covered by synovial membrane).
6.  **Nerves and Blood Vessels:** Richly supplied with sensory nerve fibers (detect pain, stretch, position) and blood vessels (supply synovial membrane).

## Accessory Structures (Not present in all synovial joints):

*   **Fatty Pads:** Cushions between fibrous layer and synovial membrane or bone.
*   **Articular Discs (Menisci):** Fibrocartilage discs or wedges separating articular surfaces (e.g., knee, TMJ). Improve fit between bones, stabilize joint, minimize wear.
*   **Bursae:** Flattened fibrous sacs lined with synovial membrane and containing synovial fluid. Act as "ball bearings" where ligaments, muscles, skin, tendons, or bones rub together.
*   **Tendon Sheaths:** Elongated bursae that wrap completely around tendons subjected to friction (common where tendons pass through narrow canals).

## Factors Influencing Synovial Joint Stability:

*   **Shape of Articular Surfaces:** How well the bones fit together (minor role in most joints, but important in hip).
*   **Ligaments:** Number and positioning of ligaments (more ligaments = stronger joint). Can only stretch ~6% before tearing.
*   **Muscle Tone:** Tension in muscles crossing the joint; the *most important* stabilizing factor for many joints (e.g., shoulder, knee).

## Types of Synovial Joints (Based on Shape of Articular Surfaces & Movement Allowed):

1.  **Plane Joint:** Flat articular surfaces; allow short gliding/translational movements (nonaxial). Ex: Intercarpal, intertarsal joints.
2.  **Hinge Joint:** Cylindrical projection fits into a trough-shaped surface; motion along a single plane (uniaxial flexion/extension). Ex: Elbow, interphalangeal joints.
3.  **Pivot Joint:** Rounded end of one bone protrudes into a "sleeve" or ring of another bone/ligament; rotation around a long axis (uniaxial). Ex: Proximal radioulnar joint, atlantoaxial joint (C1/C2).
4.  **Condylar (Ellipsoidal) Joint:** Oval articular surface fits into a complementary depression; allows movement in two planes (biaxial: flexion/extension, abduction/adduction). Ex: Radiocarpal (wrist), metacarpophalangeal (knuckle) joints.
5.  **Saddle Joint:** Each articular surface has both concave and convex areas (like a saddle); allows biaxial movement similar to condylar joints, but greater freedom. Ex: Carpometacarpal joint of the thumb.
6.  **Ball-and-Socket Joint:** Spherical head articulates with a cup-like socket; allows movement in all axes and planes (multiaxial: flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, rotation). Ex: Shoulder, hip joints.

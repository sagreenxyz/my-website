# Summary: 9.3 Cartilaginous Joints

This section describes cartilaginous joints, where bones are united by cartilage tissue (either hyaline cartilage or fibrocartilage) and lack a joint cavity. Most allow limited movement (amphiarthroses), though some are immovable (synarthroses).

## General Characteristics:

*   **Articulating Bones:** Connected by cartilage.
*   **Joint Cavity:** Absent.
*   **Movement:** Typically slightly movable (amphiarthrotic) or immovable (synarthrotic).

## Types of Cartilaginous Joints:

1.  **Synchondroses (Singular: Synchondrosis):**
    *   **Connecting Material:** A bar or plate of **hyaline cartilage** unites the bones.
    *   **Movement:** Immovable (synarthrotic).
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Epiphyseal Plates:** Temporary hyaline cartilage joints in long bones of children, connecting the diaphysis and epiphysis. They allow bone growth and eventually ossify to become synostoses (bony junctions).
        *   **Joint between the first rib and the manubrium of the sternum:** This specific costosternal joint is a synchondrosis (immovable). (Note: Other costosternal joints are synovial).
2.  **Symphyses (Singular: Symphysis):**
    *   **Connecting Material:** **Fibrocartilage** unites the bones. Hyaline cartilage is also present on the articular surfaces of the bones. Fibrocartilage acts as a compressible pad or shock absorber.
    *   **Movement:** Slightly movable (amphiarthrotic). Designed for strength with flexibility.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Intervertebral Joints:** Fibrocartilaginous discs between adjacent vertebrae provide cushioning and limited movement.
        *   **Pubic Symphysis:** Fibrocartilaginous joint connecting the two pubic bones anteriorly. Allows slight movement, particularly during childbirth.

Cartilaginous joints provide stable connections between bones while allowing for either growth (epiphyseal plates) or limited flexibility and shock absorption (symphyses).

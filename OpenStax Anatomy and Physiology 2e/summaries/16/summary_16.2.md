# Summary: 16.2 The Mental Status Exam

This section details the mental status exam, which assesses higher cognitive functions primarily associated with the cerebrum. It evaluates orientation, memory, language, sensorium, and judgment/abstract reasoning.

## Key Components:

*   **Orientation:** Assesses awareness of self, time, place, and situation. Often tested by asking the patient their name, the date/day, their current location, and why they are there ("oriented x4"). Deficits can indicate widespread cerebral dysfunction (e.g., delirium, dementia).
*   **Memory:** Evaluates the ability to recall information.
    *   **Registration:** Ability to immediately repeat information (e.g., three words).
    *   **Short-term (Working) Memory:** Ability to recall information after a brief delay (e.g., recalling the three words after 5 minutes). Often involves the hippocampus and temporal lobe.
    *   **Long-term Memory:** Ability to recall past events or established knowledge (e.g., historical events, personal history). Involves widespread cortical areas.
*   **Language:** Assesses comprehension and expression.
    *   **Fluency:** Smoothness and ease of speech production.
    *   **Comprehension:** Understanding spoken and written language.
    *   **Naming:** Ability to name objects.
    *   **Repetition:** Ability to repeat phrases.
    *   **Reading & Writing:** Assessed as needed.
    *   Deficits (aphasia) often localize to specific areas in the dominant hemisphere (usually left), such as Broca's area (expressive aphasia) or Wernicke's area (receptive aphasia).
*   **Sensorium:** Assesses the patient's interaction with the environment, including attention, calculation, and perception.
    *   **Attention/Concentration:** Ability to focus (e.g., spelling "world" backwards, serial sevens).
    *   **Praxis:** Ability to perform learned motor tasks on command (e.g., pretending to comb hair). Deficits (apraxia) suggest cortical issues.
    *   **Gnosis:** Ability to recognize objects using senses (e.g., stereognosis - recognizing objects by touch; graphesthesia - recognizing numbers written on skin). Deficits (agnosia) suggest parietal lobe issues.
*   **Judgment and Abstract Reasoning:** Assesses problem-solving, insight, and the ability to interpret concepts beyond the literal meaning (e.g., explaining proverbs). Often involves frontal lobe function.
*   **Mood and Affect:** Observation of the patient's emotional state.

The mental status exam provides valuable information about cerebral function and can help localize lesions or identify diffuse cognitive impairment.

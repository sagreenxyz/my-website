# Summary: 10.2 Skeletal Muscle

This section delves into the microscopic anatomy of skeletal muscle tissue, from the whole muscle down to the molecular level, and explains how nerve signals initiate muscle contraction at the neuromuscular junction.

## Gross Anatomy and Connective Tissues:

*   Skeletal muscles are organs attached to bones or skin.
*   **Connective Tissue Sheaths:** Support cells and reinforce the muscle.
    *   **Epimysium:** Dense irregular connective tissue surrounding the entire muscle.
    *   **Perimysium:** Fibrous connective tissue surrounding fascicles (groups of muscle fibers).
    *   **Endomysium:** Fine areolar connective tissue surrounding each individual muscle fiber.
*   These sheaths merge to form **tendons** or **aponeuroses**, which attach muscles to bones.

## Microscopic Anatomy of a Skeletal Muscle Fiber:

*   **Muscle Fiber:** A single, long, cylindrical, multinucleated cell.
*   **Sarcolemma:** Plasma membrane of the muscle fiber.
*   **Sarcoplasm:** Cytoplasm of the muscle fiber; contains glycosomes (stored glycogen) and myoglobin (oxygen-storing pigment).
*   **Myofibrils:** Rod-like structures packed densely within the fiber, running parallel. They account for ~80% of cell volume and are the contractile elements.
*   **Striations:** Repeating series of dark A bands and light I bands along the myofibril, giving skeletal muscle its striped appearance.
*   **Sarcomere:** The smallest contractile unit of a muscle fiber; the region of a myofibril between two successive Z discs. Composed of myofilaments.
    *   **A Band:** Dark band, contains thick filaments (myosin) and overlapping thin filaments (actin).
    *   **I Band:** Light band, contains only thin filaments (actin). Z disc runs through the center.
    *   **H Zone:** Lighter region in the midsection of the A band where thin filaments do not overlap thick filaments (visible only in relaxed muscle).
    *   **M Line:** Dark line bisecting the H zone; proteins that link adjacent thick filaments.
    *   **Z Disc (Line):** Coin-shaped sheet of proteins anchoring the thin filaments and connecting myofibrils.
*   **Myofilaments:** Contractile proteins within the sarcomere.
    *   **Thick Filaments:** Composed primarily of the protein **myosin**. Each myosin molecule has a tail and two globular heads (cross-bridges) that bind to actin and ATP.
    *   **Thin Filaments:** Composed primarily of the protein **actin**. Actin subunits have active sites for myosin head attachment. Also contain regulatory proteins:
        *   **Tropomyosin:** Rod-shaped protein that spirals around actin, blocking myosin-binding sites in a relaxed muscle.
        *   **Troponin:** Globular complex bound to actin and tropomyosin; binds Ca²⁺ ions, which initiates contraction.
    *   **Elastic Filament:** Composed of the protein **titin**; extends from Z disc to thick filament, holding thick filaments in place and helping muscle recoil.
*   **Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR):** Specialized smooth endoplasmic reticulum surrounding each myofibril. Stores and releases calcium ions (Ca²⁺). Forms **terminal cisternae** at A-I junctions.
*   **T-Tubules (Transverse Tubules):** Invaginations of the sarcolemma that penetrate deep into the cell at the A-band/I-band junctions. Conduct electrical impulses (action potentials) from the surface deep into the fiber.
*   **Triad:** Structure formed by a T-tubule and the two terminal cisternae flanking it; crucial for excitation-contraction coupling.

## The Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ):

*   The site where a motor neuron communicates with a muscle fiber.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Axon Terminal:** End of the motor neuron's axon; contains synaptic vesicles filled with the neurotransmitter **acetylcholine (ACh)**.
    *   **Synaptic Cleft:** Small fluid-filled space between the axon terminal and the muscle fiber.
    *   **Motor End Plate:** Specialized region of the sarcolemma at the NMJ; highly folded (junctional folds) and rich in **ACh receptors**.
*   **Events at the NMJ:**
    1.  Action potential arrives at axon terminal.
    2.  Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open; Ca²⁺ enters axon terminal.
    3.  Ca²⁺ entry causes synaptic vesicles to release ACh via exocytosis into the synaptic cleft.
    4.  ACh diffuses across the cleft and binds to ACh receptors on the motor end plate.
    5.  Binding opens ligand-gated ion channels permeable to Na⁺ and K⁺. More Na⁺ enters than K⁺ exits, causing local depolarization (**End Plate Potential - EPP**).
    6.  EPP spreads to adjacent sarcolemma and triggers opening of voltage-gated Na⁺ channels, initiating an **action potential (AP)** that propagates along the sarcolemma.
    7.  ACh effects are terminated by the enzyme **acetylcholinesterase (AChE)** in the synaptic cleft, breaking down ACh.

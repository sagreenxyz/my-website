# Summary: 10.5 Types of Muscle Fibers

This section classifies skeletal muscle fibers into different types based on their speed of contraction and primary pathway for ATP synthesis. These characteristics determine the fiber's functional properties, such as power, endurance, and fatigue resistance.

## Classification Criteria:

1.  **Speed of Contraction:**
    *   Based on the speed at which myosin ATPases split ATP, determining cross-bridge cycling rate.
    *   **Fast Fibers:** High myosin ATPase activity, rapid cross-bridge cycling, fast contraction velocity.
    *   **Slow Fibers:** Low myosin ATPase activity, slower cross-bridge cycling, slow contraction velocity.
2.  **Major Pathway for ATP Synthesis:**
    *   **Oxidative Fibers:** Rely primarily on aerobic respiration (using oxygen) in mitochondria. High endurance, fatigue-resistant.
    *   **Glycolytic Fibers:** Rely primarily on anaerobic glycolysis (without oxygen) in the cytoplasm. Generate ATP quickly but fatigue rapidly due to lactic acid buildup and limited glucose/glycogen stores.

## Major Skeletal Muscle Fiber Types:

Combining these criteria yields three main fiber types:

1.  **Slow Oxidative (SO) Fibers (Type I):**
    *   **Contraction Speed:** Slow (slow myosin ATPase).
    *   **ATP Synthesis:** Aerobic (high oxidative capacity).
    *   **Characteristics:** Many mitochondria, rich capillary supply, high myoglobin content (appear red), small diameter.
    *   **Function:** Maintain posture, endurance activities (e.g., running a marathon). Fatigue-resistant. Low power.
2.  **Fast Oxidative-Glycolytic (FOG) Fibers (Type IIa):**
    *   **Contraction Speed:** Fast (fast myosin ATPase).
    *   **ATP Synthesis:** Primarily aerobic, but also significant anaerobic capacity.
    *   **Characteristics:** Many mitochondria, good capillary supply, high myoglobin (appear red to pink), intermediate diameter.
    *   **Function:** Intermediate properties; moderately fatigue-resistant. Used for activities like sprinting or walking. Medium power.
3.  **Fast Glycolytic (FG) Fibers (Type IIx or IIb):**
    *   **Contraction Speed:** Fast (fast myosin ATPase).
    *   **ATP Synthesis:** Primarily anaerobic glycolysis.
    *   **Characteristics:** Few mitochondria, low capillary supply, low myoglobin (appear white), large diameter (more myofilaments). Store large amounts of glycogen.
    *   **Function:** Powerful, rapid contractions (e.g., hitting a baseball, lifting heavy weights). Fatigue quickly. High power.

## Distribution and Recruitment:

*   Most muscles contain a mixture of all three fiber types, but the proportions vary depending on the muscle's usual action (e.g., postural muscles have more SO fibers; arm muscles for rapid movements have more FG fibers).
*   Motor units contain fibers of only one type.
*   Fiber type proportions can be influenced by genetics and training (e.g., endurance training can increase the oxidative capacity of FG fibers, making them behave more like FOG fibers).
*   Recruitment order typically follows size principle: SO fibers (smallest motor units) recruited first, then FOG, then FG (largest motor units) as more force is needed.

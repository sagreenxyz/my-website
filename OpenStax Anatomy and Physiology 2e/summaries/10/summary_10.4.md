# Summary: 10.4 Nervous System Control of Muscle Tension

This section explains how the nervous system regulates the force generated by skeletal muscles, from the activation of a single motor unit to the graded responses of a whole muscle.

## The Motor Unit:

*   **Definition:** A single motor neuron and all the skeletal muscle fibers it innervates.
*   **Function:** When a motor neuron fires an action potential, all muscle fibers within its motor unit contract simultaneously.
*   **Size Variation:**
    *   **Small Motor Units:** One neuron innervates few fibers (e.g., <10). Found in muscles requiring fine control (e.g., eye muscles, fingers).
    *   **Large Motor Units:** One neuron innervates many fibers (e.g., >1000). Found in large, weight-bearing muscles requiring powerful contractions (e.g., thigh, back muscles).

## The Muscle Twitch:

*   **Definition:** The response of a muscle (or motor unit) to a single, brief threshold stimulus.
*   **Phases (Myogram):**
    1.  **Latent Period:** Time between stimulation and the beginning of contraction. Events of excitation-contraction coupling occur.
    2.  **Contraction Period:** Cross-bridges are active; muscle tension increases to a peak.
    3.  **Relaxation Period:** Ca²⁺ is pumped back into the SR; cross-bridges detach; muscle tension decreases to zero.
*   Twitches vary in speed and duration depending on the muscle type (e.g., faster in eye muscles, slower in postural muscles).

## Graded Muscle Responses:

*   Muscle contractions in the body are smooth and vary in strength (graded), unlike single twitches. Graded responses are achieved by changing:
    1.  **Frequency of Stimulation:**
        *   **Wave (Temporal) Summation:** If a second stimulus arrives before the muscle fully relaxes from the first, the second contraction will be stronger. Ca²⁺ levels remain elevated.
        *   **Incomplete (Unfused) Tetanus:** With further increases in stimulus frequency, the muscle shows sustained but quivering contraction as partial relaxation occurs between stimuli.
        *   **Complete (Fused) Tetanus:** At very high stimulus frequencies, relaxation time is eliminated, resulting in a smooth, sustained contraction plateau. (Rarely occurs physiologically).
    2.  **Strength of Stimulation (Recruitment):**
        *   **Multiple Motor Unit Summation (Recruitment):** Increasing the voltage (strength) of stimulation activates more motor units.
        *   **Size Principle:** Smaller motor units (with more excitable neurons) are recruited first, followed by larger motor units as stimulus intensity increases. This allows for smooth increases in force and delays fatigue (smaller, fatigue-resistant units used first).

## Muscle Tone:

*   **Definition:** Low level of sustained contraction in relaxed skeletal muscles; keeps muscles firm, healthy, and ready to respond.
*   **Mechanism:** Due to spinal reflexes activating different groups of motor units asynchronously over time. Does not produce active movement.
*   **Function:** Stabilizes joints and maintains posture.

## Isotonic and Isometric Contractions:

*   **Isotonic Contraction:** Muscle changes length and moves a load. Tension remains relatively constant once sufficient to move the load.
    *   **Concentric:** Muscle shortens and does work (e.g., picking up a book).
    *   **Eccentric:** Muscle lengthens while generating force (e.g., lowering a book slowly); often causes more micro-damage and soreness.
*   **Isometric Contraction:** Muscle develops tension but does not change length. Load is greater than the force the muscle can generate, or muscle acts to hold a joint stationary. (e.g., pushing against an immovable wall, holding a heavy object steady).

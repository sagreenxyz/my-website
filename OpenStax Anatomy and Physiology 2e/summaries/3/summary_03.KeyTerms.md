# Summary: Chapter 3 Key Terms

This section lists important terminology related to the cellular level of organization discussed in Chapter 3.

*(Note: The specific terms are derived from the HTML content. Below is a representation of the types of terms typically found.)*

*   **Active Transport:** Membrane transport requiring energy (ATP) to move substances against their concentration gradient.
*   **Cell Cycle:** Life cycle of a cell, including interphase and mitosis.
*   **Chromatin:** Complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes within the nucleus.
*   **Cilia:** Short, hair-like projections from the cell surface, involved in moving substances across the cell surface.
*   **Cytokinesis:** Division of the cytoplasm following mitosis.
*   **Cytoplasm:** Cellular material between the plasma membrane and the nucleus, including cytosol and organelles.
*   **Cytoskeleton:** Network of protein filaments (microtubules, microfilaments, intermediate filaments) providing support and enabling movement.
*   **Cytosol:** Fluid portion of the cytoplasm.
*   **Diffusion:** Movement of substances from an area of higher concentration to lower concentration.
*   **Differentiation:** Process by which cells become specialized.
*   **Endocytosis:** Process of bringing substances into the cell via vesicle formation (phagocytosis, pinocytosis).
*   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):** Network of membranes involved in synthesis and transport (Rough ER: protein synthesis; Smooth ER: lipid synthesis, detoxification).
*   **Exocytosis:** Process of releasing substances from the cell via vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane.
*   **Facilitated Diffusion:** Passive transport requiring a membrane protein.
*   **Flagellum:** Long, whip-like projection used for cell propulsion (e.g., sperm tail).
*   **Golgi Apparatus:** Organelle that modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids.
*   **Interphase:** Period of the cell cycle when the cell grows and DNA replicates.
*   **Lysosome:** Organelle containing digestive enzymes.
*   **Microvilli:** Finger-like extensions of the plasma membrane that increase surface area.
*   **Mitochondrion:** Organelle responsible for ATP production (cellular respiration).
*   **Mitosis:** Process of nuclear division resulting in two identical daughter nuclei.
*   **Nucleolus:** Structure within the nucleus involved in ribosome synthesis.
*   **Nucleus:** Control center of the cell, containing DNA.
*   **Organelle:** Specialized structure within a cell performing specific functions.
*   **Osmosis:** Diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane.
*   **Passive Transport:** Membrane transport not requiring cellular energy.
*   **Peroxisome:** Organelle involved in neutralizing harmful substances.
*   **Plasma Membrane:** Outer boundary of the cell, regulating passage of substances.
*   **Ribosome:** Site of protein synthesis.
*   **Selectively Permeable:** Property of membranes allowing only certain substances to pass.
*   **Transcription:** Synthesis of RNA from a DNA template.
*   **Translation:** Synthesis of protein from an mRNA template.
*   **Vesicle:** Small, membrane-bound sac involved in transport.

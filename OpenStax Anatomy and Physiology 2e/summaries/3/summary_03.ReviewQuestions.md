# Summary: Chapter 3 Review Questions

This section contains review questions designed to test comprehension of the key concepts covered in Chapter 3 regarding the cellular level of organization. The questions likely cover topics such as:

*   The main components of a typical human cell: plasma membrane, cytoplasm (cytosol and organelles), and nucleus.
*   Structure and functions of the plasma membrane (phospholipid bilayer, proteins, cholesterol, glycocalyx).
*   Mechanisms of membrane transport: passive processes (diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion) and active processes (active transport, vesicular transport - endocytosis, exocytosis).
*   Structure and function of major cellular organelles (mitochondria, ribosomes, ER, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, peroxisomes, cytoskeleton, centrioles).
*   Structure and function of the nucleus (nuclear envelope, nucleolus, chromatin).
*   Overview of protein synthesis (transcription and translation).
*   The cell cycle, including interphase and mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase) and cytokinesis.
*   Concept of cellular differentiation.

# Summary: Chapter 3 Chapter Review - The Cellular Level of Organization

This chapter review consolidates the information presented about the cell, the fundamental unit of structure and function in the human body.

## Key Concepts Recapped:

*   **3.1 The Cell Membrane:** Describes the fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane, composed primarily of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins, cholesterol, and carbohydrates (glycocalyx). Explains its role in boundary definition, communication, and selective permeability.
*   **3.2 Transport Across the Cell Membrane:** Details mechanisms for substance movement:
    *   **Passive Transport:** No energy required; includes simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion (channel-mediated and carrier-mediated), and osmosis (water movement). Discusses tonicity (isotonic, hypertonic, hypotonic solutions).
    *   **Active Transport:** Requires ATP; includes primary active transport (e.g., Na+/K+ pump), secondary active transport (cotransport/counter-transport), and vesicular transport (endocytosis - phagocytosis, pinocytosis, receptor-mediated; and exocytosis).
*   **3.3 Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles:** Describes the cytosol (intracellular fluid) and the various organelles suspended within it, detailing the structure and function of:
    *   **Mitochondria:** ATP synthesis.
    *   **Ribosomes:** Protein synthesis.
    *   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough & Smooth):** Protein modification/synthesis, lipid synthesis, detoxification.
    *   **Golgi Apparatus:** Modifying, sorting, packaging proteins and lipids.
    *   **Lysosomes:** Digestion of cellular waste and foreign material.
    *   **Peroxisomes:** Neutralization of harmful substances.
    *   **Cytoskeleton:** Structural support, cell movement (microfilaments, intermediate filaments, microtubules).
*   **3.4 The Nucleus and DNA Replication:** Explains the structure of the nucleus (nuclear envelope, nucleoli, chromatin) as the control center containing genetic material (DNA). Details the process of DNA replication during the S phase of interphase, ensuring genetic continuity.
*   **3.5 Protein Synthesis:** Outlines the two main steps:
    *   **Transcription:** Creating an mRNA copy from a DNA gene template within the nucleus.
    *   **Translation:** Synthesizing a polypeptide chain from the mRNA sequence at the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, involving tRNA and rRNA.
*   **3.6 Cell Growth and Division:** Describes the cell cycle, consisting of:
    *   **Interphase:** Growth (G1), DNA synthesis (S), final preparations (G2).
    *   **Mitotic (M) Phase:** Mitosis (nuclear division: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase) and Cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division). Explains the purpose of mitosis for growth and repair.
*   **3.7 Cell Differentiation:** Introduces the concept of how cells become specialized in structure and function through differential gene expression, starting from unspecialized stem cells.

Understanding these cellular structures and processes is essential for comprehending physiology at all levels.

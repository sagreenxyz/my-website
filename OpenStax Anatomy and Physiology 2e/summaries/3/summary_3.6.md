# Summary: 3.6 Cellular Differentiation

This section explains how cells become specialized in structure and function during development, starting from a single fertilized egg (zygote).

## Key Concepts:

*   **Differentiation:** The process by which unspecialized cells (like embryonic stem cells) develop into specialized cell types (e.g., nerve cells, muscle cells, skin cells) with specific structures and functions.
*   **Zygote:** The initial single cell formed by fertilization, which is **totipotent** (capable of differentiating into *all* cell types, including placental cells).
*   **Embryonic Development:** As the embryo develops, cells divide and begin to specialize. This involves changes in gene expression.
*   **Gene Expression:** Although all somatic cells in an individual contain the same DNA (genome), differentiation occurs because different sets of genes are turned "on" or "off" in different cell types. This selective gene expression dictates the proteins a cell produces, which in turn determines its structure and function.
*   **Stem Cells:** Unspecialized or partially specialized cells that can divide to produce more stem cells and can differentiate into various specialized cell types.
    *   **Totipotent:** Can become any cell type (e.g., zygote, early embryonic cells).
    *   **Pluripotent:** Can become any cell type of the embryo proper (but not placental cells) (e.g., embryonic stem cells from inner cell mass).
    *   **Multipotent:** Can differentiate into a limited range of cell types within a specific lineage (e.g., adult stem cells like hematopoietic stem cells, which form blood cells).
    *   **Oligopotent:** Can differentiate into a few cell types.
    *   **Unipotent:** Can only differentiate into one specific cell type (but can still self-renew).
*   **Mechanism:** Differentiation is controlled by complex signaling pathways involving transcription factors and epigenetic modifications (changes to DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence).

Cellular differentiation is fundamental to the development of complex multicellular organisms, allowing for the formation of specialized tissues and organs from a single fertilized egg.

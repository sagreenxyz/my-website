# Summary: Chapter 3 Review Questions

This section contains review questions designed to test comprehension of the key concepts covered in Chapter 3, focusing on the cellular level of organization. The questions likely cover topics such as:

*   The main components of a typical human cell (plasma membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus).
*   Structure and function of the plasma membrane (phospholipid bilayer, proteins, cholesterol, glycocalyx).
*   Mechanisms of membrane transport (passive: diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion; active: primary/secondary active transport, vesicular transport - endocytosis, exocytosis).
*   Structure and function of cytoplasm and organelles (cytosol, mitochondria, ribosomes, ER, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, peroxisomes, cytoskeleton).
*   Structure and function of the nucleus (nuclear envelope, nucleolus, chromatin).
*   Overview of protein synthesis (transcription and translation).
*   The cell cycle (interphase - G1, S, G2; mitotic phase - mitosis, cytokinesis).
*   Stages of mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase).
*   Cell differentiation and the concept of stem cells.

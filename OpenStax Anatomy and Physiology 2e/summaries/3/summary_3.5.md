# Summary: 3.5 Cell Growth and Division

This section describes the cell cycle, the series of events leading to cell duplication, including interphase (growth and DNA replication) and the mitotic phase (nuclear and cytoplasmic division).

## The Cell Cycle:

*   Orderly sequence of events from cell formation to division into two daughter cells.
*   Two major periods:
    *   **Interphase:** Period of cell growth and metabolic activity; DNA is replicated. The longest phase.
    *   **Mitotic (M) Phase:** Period of cell division, involving mitosis (nuclear division) and cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division).

## Interphase:

*   Cell prepares for division. DNA is in chromatin form.
*   Subphases:
    *   **G1 (Gap 1):** Cell growth, protein synthesis, normal metabolic activity. Centrioles start replicating. Checkpoint ensures conditions are favorable for division.
    *   **S (Synthesis):** DNA replication occurs. Each chromosome is duplicated, forming sister chromatids joined at the centromere.
    *   **G2 (Gap 2):** Further growth, synthesis of proteins and enzymes needed for division. Centriole replication completed. Checkpoint ensures DNA replication is complete and accurate.

## Mitotic (M) Phase:

*   Division of the nucleus (mitosis) followed by division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis). Produces two genetically identical daughter cells. Essential for growth, repair, and development.
*   **Mitosis Stages:**
    1.  **Prophase:**
        *   Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes (sister chromatids).
        *   Nuclear envelope breaks down.
        *   Nucleolus disappears.
        *   Centrosomes move to opposite poles, forming the mitotic spindle (microtubules).
    2.  **Metaphase:**
        *   Chromosomes align at the cell's equator, forming the metaphase plate. Spindle fibers attach to the centromeres.
    3.  **Anaphase:**
        *   Sister chromatids separate at the centromere and are pulled towards opposite poles by shortening spindle fibers. Each chromatid is now considered a chromosome.
    4.  **Telophase:** (Reverse of prophase)
        *   Chromosomes arrive at poles and decondense back into chromatin.
        *   Nuclear envelope reforms around each chromatin mass.
        *   Nucleoli reappear.
        *   Spindle breaks down.
*   **Cytokinesis:**
    *   Division of the cytoplasm. Usually begins during late anaphase/telophase.
    *   A contractile ring of actin filaments forms a cleavage furrow, pinching the cell into two separate daughter cells.

## Control of Cell Division:

*   Regulated by internal signals (e.g., cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases - Cdks) and external signals (e.g., growth factors, contact inhibition).
*   Checkpoints (G1, G2, M) ensure the cycle proceeds correctly.
*   Loss of control can lead to **cancer** (uncontrolled cell growth and division).

Cell division is a tightly regulated process crucial for life.

# Summary: 8.5 Development of the Appendicular Skeleton

This section describes the embryonic and fetal development of the pectoral and pelvic girdles and the limbs.

*   **Limb Buds:** The upper and lower limbs first appear as small elevations called limb buds during the fourth and fifth weeks of development. These arise from the lateral plate mesoderm.
*   **Apical Ectodermal Ridge (AER):** A thickened ridge of ectoderm at the apex of each limb bud that controls proximal-distal limb growth.
*   **Mesenchyme:** The core of the limb bud consists of mesenchyme, which will differentiate into the bones and connective tissues of the limb.
*   **Endochondral Ossification:** All bones of the appendicular skeleton, except for the clavicle, develop via endochondral ossification. Mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes, forming hyaline cartilage models of the future bones. These models are then gradually replaced by bone.
*   **Clavicle Development:** The clavicle is the only appendicular bone that develops primarily through intramembranous ossification, starting as mesenchymal condensations. Its ends later form via endochondral ossification.
*   **Limb Rotation:** During development, the upper limbs rotate laterally by 90 degrees, and the lower limbs rotate medially by 90 degrees, establishing the adult anatomical position.
*   **Ossification Centers:** Primary ossification centers appear in the diaphysis (shaft) of long bones before birth. Secondary ossification centers appear in the epiphyses (ends) mostly after birth.
*   **Joint Formation:** Joints develop from the interzonal mesenchyme located between the developing cartilage models.

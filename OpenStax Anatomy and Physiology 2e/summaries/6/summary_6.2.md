# Summary: 6.2 Bone Classification

This section categorizes bones based on their shape and describes the general features associated with each category.

*   **Classification by Shape:** Bones are classified into five main types based on their overall shape, not their size.
    1.  **Long Bones:**
        *   Characterized by being longer than they are wide.
        *   Have a shaft (diaphysis) and two distinct ends (epiphyses).
        *   Composed primarily of compact bone in the diaphysis and spongy bone in the epiphyses.
        *   Function as levers for movement.
        *   Examples: Humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, fibula, metacarpals, metatarsals, phalanges.
    2.  **Short Bones:**
        *   Roughly cube-shaped; nearly equal in length and width.
        *   Consist mainly of spongy bone covered by a thin layer of compact bone.
        *   Provide stability and support, allowing for limited motion.
        *   Examples: Carpals (wrist bones) and Tarsals (ankle bones).
    3.  **Flat Bones:**
        *   Thin, flattened, and often slightly curved.
        *   Structure resembles a sandwich: two thin layers of compact bone enclosing a layer of spongy bone (called diploe in cranial bones).
        *   Provide protection for underlying organs and offer broad surfaces for muscle attachment.
        *   Examples: Sternum, ribs, scapulae (shoulder blades), most cranial bones (e.g., frontal, parietal).
    4.  **Irregular Bones:**
        *   Have complex shapes that do not fit into the other categories.
        *   Composition varies, often primarily spongy bone with a thin outer layer of compact bone.
        *   Serve various specialized functions.
        *   Examples: Vertebrae, hip bones (coxal bones), some facial bones (e.g., sphenoid, ethmoid).
    5.  **Sesamoid Bones:**
        *   Small, round bones embedded within tendons.
        *   Develop in response to stress in a tendon.
        *   Act to protect tendons from excessive wear and tear and can alter the direction of pull of a tendon, improving mechanical advantage.
        *   Vary in number and location among individuals.
        *   Example: Patella (kneecap) is the largest and most consistent sesamoid bone. Others can be found in tendons of the hands and feet.

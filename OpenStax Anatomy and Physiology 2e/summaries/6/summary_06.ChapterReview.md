# Summary: Chapter 6 Chapter Review - Bone Tissue and the Skeletal System

This chapter review consolidates the information presented about bone tissue and the skeletal system.

## Key Concepts Recapped:

*   **6.1 Functions of the Skeletal System:** Covers support, protection, movement, mineral and growth factor storage (calcium, phosphorus), blood cell formation (hematopoiesis), and triglyceride (fat) storage.
*   **6.2 Bone Classification:** Describes the classification of bones based on shape: long, short, flat, irregular, and sesamoid bones.
*   **6.3 Bone Structure:** Details the gross anatomy (diaphysis, epiphyses, membranes like periosteum and endosteum) and microscopic anatomy (compact bone with osteons, spongy bone with trabeculae) of bones. Discusses the different types of bone cells (osteogenic cells, osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts) and the composition of the bone matrix.
*   **6.4 Bone Formation and Development:** Explains the two types of ossification: intramembranous (forming flat bones) and endochondral (forming most other bones from a cartilage model). Covers longitudinal growth (at the epiphyseal plate) and appositional growth (increase in width).
*   **6.5 Fractures: Bone Repair:** Discusses common types of fractures and outlines the four major stages of bone repair: hematoma formation, fibrocartilaginous callus formation, bony callus formation, and bone remodeling.
*   **6.6 Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones, and Bone Tissue:** Explores factors influencing bone health, including the role of mechanical stress (Wolff's Law), essential nutrients (calcium, vitamin D, vitamin K), and hormones (growth hormone, thyroid hormone, sex hormones, PTH, calcitonin) in bone growth and remodeling. Covers calcium homeostasis.

The chapter emphasizes that bone is a dynamic, living tissue constantly undergoing remodeling in response to various stimuli.

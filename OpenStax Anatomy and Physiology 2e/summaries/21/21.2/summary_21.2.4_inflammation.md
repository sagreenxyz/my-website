# Summary: 21.2.4 Inflammatory Response

This section describes inflammation, a hallmark localized response of the innate immune system to tissue injury or infection.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Definition:** A fundamental innate immune response characterized by four cardinal signs: **heat**, **redness**, **pain**, and **swelling** (edema). Loss of function is sometimes considered a fifth sign.
*   **Triggers:** Can be initiated by tissue damage (even without infection, e.g., physical trauma) or by pathogens breaching barriers. Damaged cell contents are sufficient to start the response.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Recruit phagocytic cells to clear cellular debris and pathogens.
    *   Isolate the site to limit pathogen spread.
    *   Destroy pathogens.
    *   Initiate tissue repair (e.g., by allowing entry of clotting factors).
    *   Facilitate transport of antigens to lymph nodes by dendritic cells to initiate adaptive immunity.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Acute Inflammation:** Short-term response to an insult.
    *   **Chronic Inflammation:** Ongoing, long-term inflammation if the cause isn't resolved. Associated with tissue destruction and fibrosis (e.g., due to foreign bodies, persistent pathogens, autoimmune diseases).

*   **Four Key Parts of the Inflammatory Response:**
    1.  **Tissue Injury & Mediator Release:**
        *   Injured cells release contents, stimulating **mast cells** to degranulate.
        *   Mast cells release potent mediators: **histamine**, **leukotrienes**, **prostaglandins**.
        *   Injured cells, phagocytes, and basophils also release mediators.
    2.  **Vasodilation:**
        *   Mediators like histamine and prostaglandins cause local blood vessels (capillaries) to widen.
        *   Increases blood flow, causing **heat** and **redness**.
        *   Allows greater access of blood components (cells, plasma) to the site.
    3.  **Increased Vascular Permeability:**
        *   Mediators like histamine and leukotrienes make capillary walls "leakier".
        *   Plasma leaks into the interstitial space, causing **swelling** (edema).
    4.  **Recruitment of Phagocytes:**
        *   **Leukotrienes** act as chemotactic agents, attracting **neutrophils** from the blood to the site.
        *   Neutrophils are early responders, followed by **macrophages** which clean up debris and remaining pathogens.
        *   Accumulation of dead neutrophils and cellular debris can form **pus**.

*   **Key Mediators:**
    *   **Histamine:** Causes vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.
    *   **Leukotrienes:** Attract neutrophils (chemotaxis) and increase vascular permeability.
    *   **Prostaglandins:** Cause vasodilation and contribute significantly to **pain**. (NSAIDs like aspirin inhibit prostaglandin production).

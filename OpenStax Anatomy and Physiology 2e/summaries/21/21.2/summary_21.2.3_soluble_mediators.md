# Summary: 21.2.3 Soluble Mediators of the Innate Immune Response

This section describes soluble factors (proteins and chemical mediators) that are crucial for communication and function within the innate immune system.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Cytokines:**
    *   Signaling molecules enabling short-distance communication between cells.
    *   Secreted into the intercellular space, inducing physiological changes in receiving cells.
*   **Chemokines:**
    *   Similar to cytokines but primarily function to attract cells (**chemotaxis**) from longer distances to sites of inflammation or infection.

*   **Early Induced Proteins:**
    *   Proteins not always present but synthesized as needed early in the innate response.
    *   **Interferons:** Secreted by virus-infected cells; travel to adjacent cells, inducing them to produce antiviral proteins, thus protecting surrounding cells.
    *   **Mannose-binding protein & C-reactive protein:** Made in the liver; bind to bacterial cell wall components. Macrophages have receptors for these proteins, facilitating recognition and phagocytosis.
    *   **Opsonization:** The process of tagging a pathogen for phagocytosis by binding an antibody or antimicrobial protein (like mannose-binding protein, C-reactive protein, or complement components).

*   **Complement System:**
    *   A cascade of ~20 plasma proteins, constitutively present (made in the liver).
    *   Functions in both innate and adaptive immunity.
    *   Activation occurs via pathways:
        *   **Alternate Pathway (Innate):** Activated spontaneously by pathogens. C3 splits; C3b binds pathogen, C3a acts as chemotactic agent.
        *   **Classical Pathway (Adaptive):** Requires antibodies bound to antigen for activation (C1 complex interaction).
    *   **Cascade Mechanism:** Activated proteins enzymatically alter and fragment subsequent proteins in a series. The splitting of **C3** into C3a and C3b is a common step.
    *   **Functions of Complement Fragments:**
        1.  **Opsonization:** C3b binds to pathogen surfaces, marking them for phagocytosis by cells with C3b receptors.
        2.  **Chemotaxis:** Smaller fragments (like C3a) diffuse away and attract phagocytic cells to the inflammation site.
        3.  **Membrane Attack Complex (MAC):** Formed by terminal complement proteins (C5-C9). Creates pores in pathogen membranes, disrupting osmotic balance and killing the cell (especially effective against bacteria).

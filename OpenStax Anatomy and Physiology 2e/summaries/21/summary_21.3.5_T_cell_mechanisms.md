# Summary: 21.3.5 Mechanisms of T Cell-mediated Immune Responses

This section explains how T cells are activated and proliferate to mount an effective immune response, focusing on clonal selection and expansion.

## Key Concepts:

*   **T Cell Activation:** Mature T cells become activated when their T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognizes a specific processed foreign antigen presented by a self-MHC molecule on an antigen-presenting cell (APC) or infected cell.
*   **Specificity:** The ability of a T cell to recognize a specific antigen is determined by the unique structure (amino acid sequence and 3D shape) of the antigen-binding site on its TCR, formed by the variable regions of the TCR chains.
*   **Clonal Selection:**
    *   The process by which only those T cells with TCRs specific for the encountered antigen are "selected" for activation.
    *   Proposed by Frank Burnet (1950s).
    *   An individual possesses a vast repertoire (estimated 10<sup>11</sup>) of different T cell **clones**.
    *   A **clone** is a group of T cells sharing the exact same antigen receptor.
    *   Each clone exists in very low numbers in the body before encountering its specific antigen.
*   **Clonal Expansion:**
    *   Upon activation by clonal selection, the selected T cell undergoes rapid cell division (mitosis).
    *   This proliferation creates a large population (many copies) of identical T cells (the clone), all specific for the activating antigen.
    *   Clonal expansion is essential to generate enough specific T cells to effectively combat the pathogen.
*   **Polyclonal Response:**
    *   Most pathogens have multiple different antigenic determinants (epitopes).
    *   Therefore, an immune response to a typical pathogen usually involves the activation and expansion of *multiple* different T cell clones, each specific for a different epitope on that pathogen. This is called a polyclonal response.

In essence, the immune system selects the few T cells with the right receptors for the current threat and then rapidly expands their numbers to create a large, targeted army to fight the infection.

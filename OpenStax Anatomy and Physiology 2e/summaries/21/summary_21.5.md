# Summary: 21.5 The Immune Response against Pathogens

This section explains how the innate and adaptive immune systems coordinate to combat different types of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites).

## Immune Response Strategies:

*   **Extracellular Bacteria:**
    *   **Innate:** Complement activation (MAC, opsonization), phagocytosis (neutrophils, macrophages), inflammation.
    *   **Adaptive:** Primarily humoral immunity. Antibodies (IgG, IgM) neutralize toxins, opsonize bacteria, activate complement, and cause agglutination. T<sub>H</sub> cells activate B cells and macrophages.
*   **Intracellular Bacteria (e.g., Listeria, Mycobacterium):**
    *   **Innate:** Phagocytosis by macrophages, NK cell activity.
    *   **Adaptive:** Primarily cell-mediated immunity. T<sub>H</sub>1 cells activate macrophages to kill ingested bacteria. Cytotoxic T cells (T<sub>C</sub>) kill infected host cells. Antibodies play a lesser role once bacteria are inside cells.
*   **Viruses:**
    *   **Innate:** Interferons (type I) produced by infected cells limit viral spread. NK cells kill infected cells displaying reduced MHC I or stress signals.
    *   **Adaptive:** Crucial for clearance.
        *   **Humoral:** Antibodies (IgA at mucosa, IgG/IgM in blood) neutralize viruses before they enter cells.
        *   **Cell-mediated:** T<sub>C</sub> cells recognize viral antigens on MHC I of infected cells and kill them. T<sub>H</sub> cells support T<sub>C</sub> and B cell responses.
*   **Fungi:**
    *   **Innate:** Phagocytosis (neutrophils, macrophages), complement.
    *   **Adaptive:** T<sub>H</sub>1-mediated responses seem important for activating phagocytes. Antibody roles are less clear.
*   **Parasites (Protozoa and Helminths):**
    *   Diverse strategies depending on the parasite.
    *   **Protozoa:** May involve phagocytosis, T<sub>C</sub> cells (for intracellular stages), antibodies.
    *   **Helminths (Worms):** Often too large for phagocytosis. IgE antibodies bind to worms, eosinophils bind to IgE via Fc receptors and release toxic granules (ADCC). Mast cell degranulation also contributes. T<sub>H</sub>2 responses dominate.

## Evasion Mechanisms by Pathogens:

*   **Capsules:** Prevent phagocytosis (some bacteria).
*   **Antigenic Variation:** Changing surface antigens to evade antibodies and memory cells (e.g., influenza virus, HIV, trypanosomes).
*   **Resistance to Phagocytosis:** Surviving inside phagocytes (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis).
*   **Immunosuppression:** Directly inhibiting immune cells or responses (e.g., HIV infecting T<sub>H</sub> cells).
*   **Blocking MHC Presentation:** Preventing display of antigens to T cells (some viruses).
*   **Latency:** Remaining dormant within cells, invisible to immune surveillance (e.g., herpesviruses).

The specific combination of innate and adaptive responses is tailored to the type of pathogen encountered.

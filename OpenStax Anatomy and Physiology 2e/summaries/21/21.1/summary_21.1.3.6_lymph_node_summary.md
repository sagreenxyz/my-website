# Summary: Lymph Nodes

This document summarizes the structure, function, and lymph flow within lymph nodes.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Function:**
    *   Act as "filters of the lymph," removing debris and pathogens (e.g., bacteria) from interstitial fluid transported via lymphatic capillaries.
    *   Contain dendritic cells and macrophages that internalize and kill pathogens.
    *   Serve as crucial sites for initiating and mediating adaptive immune responses involving T cells, B cells, and accessory cells.

*   **Structure:**
    *   Bean-shaped organs surrounded by a tough connective tissue **capsule**.
    *   Internal compartments formed by extensions of the capsule called **trabeculae**.
    *   Structural support provided by **reticular fibers** (produced by fibroblasts).
    *   **Cortex:** Outer region containing **lymphoid follicles**.
        *   **Lymphoid Follicles:** Contain **germinal centers** (sites of rapidly dividing B cells) surrounded by T cells and accessory cells.
    *   **Medulla:** Inner region containing **medullary cords** (consisting of B cells and plasma cells) and **medullary sinuses**.

*   **Lymph Flow:**
    *   Lymph enters via multiple **afferent lymphatic vessels**.
    *   Flows into the **subcapsular sinus** (contains dendritic cells, macrophages, reticular fibers).
    *   Percolates through the **cortex** (past follicles).
    *   Enters the **medulla** (through medullary cords and sinuses).
    *   Lymph collects in medullary sinuses before exiting via **efferent lymphatic vessels**.

# Summary: 21.2 Barrier Defenses and the Innate Immune Response

This section covers the body's first lines of defense (barriers) and the rapid, non-specific innate immune response.

## Barrier Defenses:

*   **Skin:** A primary physical barrier. Its dryness, acidity, and shedding prevent pathogen colonization.
*   **Mucous Membranes:** Line body cavities open to the exterior (respiratory, digestive, urinary, reproductive tracts).
    *   **Mucus:** Traps debris and pathogens.
    *   **Cilia:** (in respiratory tract) Propel mucus and trapped particles away.
    *   **Secretions:** Saliva, tears (contain lysozyme), stomach acid create hostile environments for pathogens.

## Innate Immune Response:

*   A rapid, non-specific response activated when barriers are breached.
*   **Cells Involved:**
    *   **Phagocytes:** Engulf and destroy pathogens.
        *   **Macrophages:** Large phagocytes derived from monocytes; also act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
        *   **Neutrophils:** Abundant, fast-acting phagocytes attracted to infection sites.
        *   **Monocytes:** Circulate in blood, differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells in tissues.
    *   **Natural Killer (NK) Cells:** Lymphocytes that recognize and kill abnormal cells (e.g., virus-infected or tumor cells) by inducing apoptosis. They detect changes in MHC I molecules.
    *   **Mast Cells:** Release histamine and other inflammatory mediators.
*   **Soluble Mediators:**
    *   **Cytokines:** Signaling proteins (e.g., interleukins, interferons, TNF) that mediate communication between immune cells, regulate inflammation, and recruit cells to infection sites. Interferons specifically help combat viral infections.
    *   **Complement System:** A cascade of plasma proteins that, when activated, enhances phagocytosis (opsonization), creates pores in pathogen membranes (MAC - membrane attack complex), and promotes inflammation.
*   **Inflammation:** A localized response to injury or infection characterized by:
    *   **Redness & Heat:** Due to increased blood flow (vasodilation).
    *   **Swelling (Edema):** Due to increased vascular permeability, allowing fluid and cells into tissues.
    *   **Pain:** Due to stimulation of nerve endings by inflammatory mediators and swelling.
    *   **Purpose:** To contain damage, eliminate pathogens, remove debris, and initiate tissue repair.
*   **Fever:** A systemic increase in body temperature, often triggered by pyrogens released during infection. It can inhibit pathogen growth and enhance immune responses.

The innate immune system provides immediate defense but lacks memory of specific pathogens.

# Summary: 20.2 Blood Flow, Blood Pressure, and Resistance

This section defines blood flow, blood pressure, and resistance, and explores the relationships between them.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Blood Flow (F):** Volume of blood flowing through a vessel, organ, or the entire circulation in a given period (mL/min). Equivalent to Cardiac Output (CO) for the entire vascular system. Flow is directly proportional to the pressure gradient (ΔP) and inversely proportional to resistance (R).
    *   **Formula:** F = ΔP / R
*   **Blood Pressure (BP):** The force per unit area exerted on a vessel wall by the contained blood (mm Hg). Refers to systemic arterial BP in large arteries near the heart.
    *   **Pressure Gradient (ΔP):** The difference in BP between two points in the circulation. Provides the driving force for blood flow. Blood flows from higher to lower pressure. Pressure is highest in the aorta and lowest in the right atrium (≈ 0 mm Hg).
*   **Resistance (R):** Opposition to flow; measure of the friction blood encounters as it passes through vessels. Also called peripheral resistance (PR) as most friction is in peripheral (systemic) circulation.
    *   **Sources of Resistance:**
        1.  *Blood Viscosity:* Internal resistance due to molecular interactions (thickness/stickiness). Fairly constant, but can change with hematocrit (e.g., polycythemia ↑R, anemia ↓R).
        2.  *Total Blood Vessel Length:* Longer vessels have greater resistance. Relatively constant in adults.
        3.  *Blood Vessel Diameter:* Most important factor influencing R. Changes frequently via vasoconstriction/vasodilation, significantly altering resistance. Resistance is inversely proportional to the *fourth power* of the radius (R ∝ 1/r⁴). Small changes in diameter cause large changes in resistance. Arterioles are the major determinants of PR.
*   **Relationship:** F = ΔP / R implies CO = MAP / R (where MAP is Mean Arterial Pressure). Therefore, MAP = CO × R. Changes in CO or R will affect MAP.

## Systemic Blood Pressure:

*   **Arterial Blood Pressure:** Reflects elasticity (compliance) of elastic arteries and volume of blood forced into them. Pulsatile.
    *   *Systolic Pressure:* Peak pressure during ventricular ejection (~120 mm Hg).
    *   *Diastolic Pressure:* Lowest pressure during ventricular relaxation (~80 mm Hg).
    *   *Pulse Pressure:* Difference between systolic and diastolic pressure (Systolic - Diastolic).
    *   *Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):* Average pressure propelling blood to tissues throughout the cardiac cycle. MAP ≈ Diastolic Pressure + (Pulse Pressure / 3). Crucial for ensuring adequate tissue perfusion.
*   **Capillary Blood Pressure:** Low (~35 mm Hg entering, ~17 mm Hg exiting). Low pressure protects fragile capillaries and allows time for exchange.
*   **Venous Blood Pressure:** Low and non-pulsatile (~15 mm Hg to 0 mm Hg). Requires functional adaptations for venous return:
    *   *Muscular Pump:* Contraction of skeletal muscles milks blood toward the heart.
    *   *Respiratory Pump:* Pressure changes during breathing move blood toward the heart.
    *   *Sympathetic Venoconstriction:* Reduces venous volume, pushing blood toward the heart.

Blood flow is driven by pressure gradients and opposed by resistance, primarily determined by vessel diameter. Systemic blood pressure decreases along the pathway from arteries to veins, with MAP being the critical pressure for tissue perfusion.

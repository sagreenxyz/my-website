This section lists important terminology related to the integumentary system discussed in Chapter 5.

*(Note: The specific terms are derived from the HTML content. Below is a representation of the types of terms typically found.)*

*   **Apocrine Sweat Gland:** Type of sweat gland associated with hair follicles, primarily in axillary and genital areas.
*   **Arrector Pili:** Smooth muscle attached to hair follicle that causes "goosebumps."
*   **Basal Cell Carcinoma:** Most common type of skin cancer, originating in the stratum basale.
*   **Dermis:** Inner layer of skin containing connective tissue, blood vessels, nerves, and accessory structures.
*   **Eccrine Sweat Gland:** Common type of sweat gland involved in thermoregulation.
*   **Epidermis:** Outermost layer of skin, composed of stratified squamous epithelium.
*   **Hair Follicle:** Structure in the dermis from which a hair grows.
*   **Hypodermis (Subcutaneous Layer):** Layer beneath the dermis, composed mainly of adipose tissue.
*   **Keratin:** Fibrous protein found in epidermis, hair, and nails.
*   **Keratinocyte:** Primary cell type in the epidermis, producing keratin.
*   **Melanin:** Pigment responsible for skin and hair color, providing UV protection.
*   **Melanocyte:** Cell in the stratum basale that produces melanin.
*   **Melanoma:** Least common but most dangerous type of skin cancer, originating in melanocytes.
*   **Nail:** Protective plate covering the dorsal surface of the distal phalanx.
*   **Papillary Layer:** Upper layer of the dermis, characterized by dermal papillae.
*   **Reticular Layer:** Deeper, thicker layer of the dermis, composed of dense irregular connective tissue.
*   **Sebaceous Gland:** Oil gland associated with hair follicles, secreting sebum.
*   **Sebum:** Oily substance secreted by sebaceous glands.
*   **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** Type of skin cancer originating in keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum.
*   **Stratum Basale:** Deepest layer of the epidermis, site of cell division.
*   **Stratum Corneum:** Outermost layer of the epidermis, composed of dead, keratinized cells.
*   **Stratum Granulosum:** Layer of the epidermis where keratinization begins.
*   **Stratum Lucidum:** Translucent layer found only in thick skin.
*   **Stratum Spinosum:** Layer of the epidermis superficial to the stratum basale, characterized by desmosomes.
*   **Vitamin D:** Synthesized in the skin upon exposure to UV radiation.

# Summary: 25.3 Gross Anatomy of the Kidney

This section describes the external and internal macroscopic structures of the kidneys, their location, and blood supply.

## Location and External Anatomy:

*   **Location:** Retroperitoneal (behind the peritoneum), superior lumbar region (T12-L3). Right kidney is slightly lower than the left due to the liver.
*   **Shape:** Bean-shaped.
*   **Hilum:** Medial concave surface where ureter, renal blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves enter/exit.
*   **Supporting Tissues (Superficial to Deep):**
    1.  **Renal Fascia:** Outer layer of dense fibrous connective tissue anchoring the kidney.
    2.  **Perirenal Fat Capsule:** Fatty mass surrounding the kidney, cushioning it.
    3.  **Fibrous Capsule:** Transparent capsule adhering to the kidney surface, preventing infection spread.

## Internal Anatomy:

*   A frontal section reveals three distinct regions:
    1.  **Renal Cortex:** Superficial region, light-colored, granular appearance (due to renal corpuscles).
    2.  **Renal Medulla:** Deep to the cortex, darker reddish-brown. Contains cone-shaped **medullary (renal) pyramids**.
        *   Pyramids appear striped due to parallel collecting ducts and capillaries.
        *   The base of each pyramid faces the cortex; the apex (**papilla**) points internally.
        *   **Renal Columns:** Inward extensions of cortical tissue separating the pyramids.
        *   A **lobe** consists of a medullary pyramid and its surrounding cortical tissue.
    3.  **Renal Pelvis:** Funnel-shaped tube continuous with the ureter leaving the hilum.
        *   **Minor Calyces:** Cup-shaped areas enclosing the papillae of the pyramids; collect urine draining from papillae.
        *   **Major Calyces:** Branching extensions of the renal pelvis that collect urine from minor calyces and empty into the renal pelvis.

## Blood and Nerve Supply:

*   **Blood Supply:** Kidneys receive ~25% of cardiac output via large **renal arteries** branching from the abdominal aorta.
    *   Path: Renal Artery -> Segmental Arteries -> Interlobar Arteries (in renal columns) -> Arcuate Arteries (at cortex-medulla junction) -> Cortical Radiate (Interlobular) Arteries (into cortex) -> Afferent Arterioles -> Glomeruli -> Efferent Arterioles -> Peritubular Capillaries / Vasa Recta -> Cortical Radiate Veins -> Arcuate Veins -> Interlobar Veins -> Renal Vein -> Inferior Vena Cava.
    *   The **portal system** (glomerulus -> efferent arteriole -> peritubular capillaries/vasa recta) is unique and crucial for filtration and reabsorption/secretion.
*   **Nerve Supply:** Via the **renal plexus**, a network of autonomic nerve fibers (primarily sympathetic) following the renal arteries.
    *   Regulates renal blood flow by adjusting arteriolar diameter.
    *   Influences renin release and urine formation.

The gross structure of the kidney reflects its function, with distinct cortical and medullary regions housing the nephrons, and a collecting system (calyces, pelvis) funneling urine towards the ureter. The rich blood supply is essential for filtration.

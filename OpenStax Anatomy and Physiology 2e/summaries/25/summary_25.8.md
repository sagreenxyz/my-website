# Summary: 25.8 Endocrine Regulation of Kidney Function

This section focuses on the major hormones that regulate kidney function, particularly influencing fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and blood pressure.

## Key Hormones and Their Actions:

*   **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS):**
    *   **Trigger:** Low blood pressure/volume, low Na+, sympathetic stimulation.
    *   **Renin:** Enzyme released by juxtaglomerular (JG) cells in the kidney. Converts angiotensinogen (from liver) to angiotensin I.
    *   **Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE):** Converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II (primarily in lungs).
    *   **Angiotensin II Effects:**
        1.  Vasoconstriction (increases blood pressure).
        2.  Stimulates aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex.
        3.  Stimulates ADH release from the posterior pituitary.
        4.  Increases thirst.
        5.  Enhances Na+ reabsorption in the PCT.
    *   **Aldosterone Effects:** Acts on DCT and collecting ducts to increase Na+ reabsorption (water follows) and K+ secretion. Raises blood volume and pressure.
*   **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) / Vasopressin:**
    *   **Source:** Produced by hypothalamus, released by posterior pituitary.
    *   **Trigger:** Increased blood osmolarity, decreased blood volume/pressure, angiotensin II.
    *   **Effect:** Increases water permeability of collecting ducts (via aquaporins), leading to increased water reabsorption and concentrated urine. Raises blood volume and pressure.
*   **Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) / Atrial Natriuretic Hormone (ANH):**
    *   **Source:** Released by atrial cells of the heart.
    *   **Trigger:** Stretching of atria due to high blood volume/pressure.
    *   **Effects (Oppose RAAS):**
        1.  Inhibits renin, aldosterone, and ADH release.
        2.  Decreases Na+ and water reabsorption in DCT/collecting ducts (promotes natriuresis and diuresis).
        3.  Causes vasodilation.
        4.  Lowers blood volume and pressure.
*   **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH):**
    *   **Source:** Parathyroid glands.
    *   **Trigger:** Low blood Ca2+.
    *   **Effect on Kidney:** Increases Ca2+ reabsorption in the DCT, inhibits phosphate reabsorption in the PCT, stimulates calcitriol activation.

Hormonal control provides fine-tuning of kidney function to maintain systemic homeostasis, particularly blood pressure, volume, osmolarity, and electrolyte balance.

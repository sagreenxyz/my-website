# Summary: 25.2 Gross Anatomy of Urine Transport

This section covers the structures involved in transporting urine from the kidneys out of the body: the ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra.

## Ureters:

*   **Function:** Slender tubes that convey urine from the kidneys (renal pelvis) to the urinary bladder.
*   **Location:** Extend retroperitoneally from the renal hilum to the posterior aspect of the bladder.
*   **Structure:**
    *   Enter the base of the bladder obliquely through the posterior wall. This arrangement prevents backflow of urine as bladder pressure increases.
    *   **Wall Layers:**
        1.  **Mucosa:** Transitional epithelium (allows stretching) continuous with kidney pelvis and bladder lining.
        2.  **Muscularis:** Two smooth muscle layers (inner longitudinal, outer circular; third longitudinal layer in lower ureter). Propels urine via peristalsis.
        3.  **Adventitia:** Outer fibrous connective tissue covering.
*   **Urine Transport:** Actively propelled by peristaltic waves responding to stretch, not solely by gravity.

## Urinary Bladder:

*   **Function:** Smooth, collapsible, muscular sac for temporary urine storage.
*   **Location:** Retroperitoneal, on the pelvic floor posterior to the pubic symphysis. (Males: anterior to rectum; Females: anterior to vagina and uterus).
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Trigone:** Smooth, triangular region at the bladder base outlined by the openings for the ureters and the urethra. Common site for infections.
    *   **Wall Layers:**
        1.  **Mucosa:** Transitional epithelium and lamina propria. Contains rugae (folds) when empty.
        2.  **Muscularis (Detrusor Muscle):** Thick layer of interwoven smooth muscle fibers (inner/outer longitudinal, middle circular). Contraction expels urine.
        3.  **Adventitia:** Outer fibrous covering (peritoneum on superior surface).
*   **Capacity:** Moderately full bladder holds ~500 ml; can hold up to 800-1000 ml.

## Urethra:

*   **Function:** Muscular tube that drains urine from the bladder out of the body.
*   **Sphincters:**
    *   **Internal Urethral Sphincter:** Involuntary smooth muscle at the bladder-urethra junction. Keeps urethra closed when urine is not being passed.
    *   **External Urethral Sphincter:** Voluntary skeletal muscle surrounding the urethra as it passes through the urogenital diaphragm. Allows voluntary control of urination.
*   **Gender Differences:**
    *   **Females:** Short (~3-4 cm). Extends from bladder to external urethral orifice anterior to the vaginal opening. Separate from the reproductive system. Higher risk of UTIs due to short length.
    *   **Males:** Longer (~20 cm). Serves both urinary and reproductive systems (carries urine and semen). Three regions:
        1.  *Prostatic urethra:* Runs within the prostate gland.
        2.  *Intermediate part (membranous urethra):* Runs through the urogenital diaphragm.
        3.  *Spongy (penile) urethra:* Passes through the penis, opens at the external urethral orifice.

## Micturition (Urination / Voiding):

*   **Process:** Act of emptying the bladder.
*   **Mechanism:** A reflex involving:
    1.  Bladder distension activates stretch receptors.
    2.  Afferent signals to sacral spinal cord.
    3.  Parasympathetic efferent signals stimulate detrusor muscle contraction and internal sphincter relaxation.
    4.  Somatic efferent signals to external sphincter are inhibited, allowing relaxation and urine release.
*   **Voluntary Control:** Higher brain centers (pons, cerebrum) can inhibit or facilitate the reflex, allowing conscious control over the external sphincter and timing of urination.

The ureters, bladder, and urethra form a continuous pathway for urine transport and expulsion, involving specialized epithelia, smooth muscle for peristalsis and expulsion, and sphincters for control.

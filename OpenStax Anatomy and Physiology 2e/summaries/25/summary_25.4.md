# Summary: 25.4 Microscopic Anatomy of the Kidney

This section delves into the structure of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney, and associated structures like the collecting ducts and the juxtaglomerular apparatus.

## The Nephron:

*   **Definition:** The structural and functional unit responsible for forming urine. Each kidney contains over a million nephrons.
*   **Main Components:**
    1.  **Renal Corpuscle:** Located in the cortex. Site of blood filtration.
        *   **Glomerulus:** A tuft of fenestrated capillaries. Supplied by an afferent arteriole, drained by an efferent arteriole.
        *   **Glomerular (Bowman's) Capsule:** Double-walled cup surrounding the glomerulus.
            *   *Parietal layer:* Simple squamous epithelium (structural).
            *   *Visceral layer:* Consists of modified epithelial cells called **podocytes**. Podocytes have foot processes (pedicels) that wrap around glomerular capillaries, forming **filtration slits** between them.
            *   *Capsular space:* Space between the two layers where filtrate collects.
    2.  **Renal Tubule:** Tube extending from the glomerular capsule. Site of reabsorption and secretion.
        *   **Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT):** Coiled tube closest to the renal corpuscle. Lined by cuboidal cells with dense microvilli (brush border) and many mitochondria (for active transport). Major site of reabsorption.
        *   **Nephron Loop (Loop of Henle):** Hairpin-shaped loop extending into the medulla.
            *   *Descending limb:* Thin segment (usually simple squamous epithelium), permeable to water.
            *   *Ascending limb:* Thick segment (cuboidal/low columnar epithelium), impermeable to water, active transport of salts. Establishes medullary osmotic gradient.
        *   **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT):** Coiled tube further from the renal corpuscle. Lined by cuboidal cells with few microvilli. Function more in secretion than reabsorption; site of hormonal control (aldosterone, PTH).

## Collecting Ducts:

*   Receive filtrate from multiple nephrons.
*   Run through medullary pyramids, giving them a striped appearance.
*   Fuse together near the renal papilla, delivering urine into minor calyces.
*   Principal cells: Regulate water (via ADH/aquaporins) and Na+/K+ balance (via aldosterone).
*   Intercalated cells: Involved in acid-base balance (secreting H+ or HCO3-).

## Types of Nephrons:

*   **Cortical Nephrons:** (~85%) Located mainly in the cortex, with short nephron loops dipping only slightly into the medulla. Associated with peritubular capillaries.
*   **Juxtamedullary Nephrons:** (~15%) Originate near the cortex-medulla junction. Have long nephron loops that extend deep into the medulla. Associated with vasa recta capillaries. Crucial for producing concentrated urine via the medullary osmotic gradient.

## Juxtaglomerular Apparatus (JGA) / Complex:

*   Region where the DCT lies against the afferent (and sometimes efferent) arteriole of its own nephron.
*   **Macula Densa:** Tall, closely packed cells in the DCT wall; act as chemoreceptors monitoring NaCl content of filtrate.
*   **Granular (Juxtaglomerular) Cells:** Enlarged smooth muscle cells in the afferent arteriole wall; act as mechanoreceptors sensing blood pressure; contain secretory granules with renin.
*   **Extraglomerular Mesangial Cells:** Interconnected cells between arteriole and tubule cells; pass signals between macula densa and granular cells.
*   **Function:** Regulates filtrate formation rate (GFR) and systemic blood pressure.

The intricate structure of the nephron, collecting ducts, and JGA enables the complex processes of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion necessary for kidney function.

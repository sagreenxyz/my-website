# Summary: 25.5 Physiology of Urine Formation

This section provides an overview of the three fundamental processes carried out by the nephrons and collecting ducts to produce urine: glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion.

## Three Basic Processes:

1.  **Glomerular Filtration:**
    *   **Location:** Glomerulus (renal corpuscle).
    *   **Process:** A passive process where hydrostatic pressure forces water and small solutes from glomerular blood into Bowman's capsule, forming the glomerular filtrate.
    *   **Filtration Membrane:** A porous membrane consisting of:
        *   Fenestrated endothelium of the glomerular capillaries.
        *   Basement membrane (basal lamina).
        *   Podocytes with filtration slits (formed by pedicels).
    *   **Selectivity:** Allows passage of water, ions, glucose, amino acids, nitrogenous wastes. Prevents passage of large proteins and blood cells.
    *   **Driving Force:** Net Filtration Pressure (NFP), determined by the balance of hydrostatic and osmotic pressures across the filtration membrane. NFP = Glomerular Blood Hydrostatic Pressure (GBHP) - [Capsular Hydrostatic Pressure (CHP) + Blood Colloid Osmotic Pressure (BCOP)]. Typically around 10 mmHg.
    *   **Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR):** The volume of filtrate formed per minute by both kidneys (normally ~125 ml/min or 180 L/day). Depends on NFP, total surface area available for filtration, and filtration membrane permeability.

2.  **Tubular Reabsorption:**
    *   **Location:** Occurs along the entire renal tubule (PCT, Loop of Henle, DCT, Collecting Duct).
    *   **Process:** Selective movement of substances from the filtrate back into the blood of the peritubular capillaries or vasa recta.
    *   **Substances Reabsorbed:** Most water (>99%), glucose, amino acids, ions (Na+, K+, Cl-, HCO3-, Ca2+), some urea.
    *   **Mechanisms:** Active transport (primary and secondary), passive transport (diffusion, osmosis). (Detailed in section 25.6).

3.  **Tubular Secretion:**
    *   **Location:** Occurs along the renal tubule and collecting duct (mainly PCT and DCT).
    *   **Process:** Selective movement of substances from the blood of the peritubular capillaries into the filtrate.
    *   **Importance:**
        *   Disposing of substances not already in the filtrate (e.g., certain drugs, metabolites bound to plasma proteins).
        *   Eliminating undesirable substances that were passively reabsorbed (e.g., urea, uric acid).
        *   Ridding the body of excess K+ (via aldosterone effect in DCT/collecting duct).
        *   Controlling blood pH (secreting H+ or HCO3- as needed).
    *   **Mechanisms:** Mainly active transport.

## Urine Formation Summary:

*   Urine = Amount Filtered - Amount Reabsorbed + Amount Secreted.
*   These three processes allow the kidneys to filter the entire plasma volume ~60 times per day, regulate fluid and electrolyte balance, and remove metabolic wastes and toxins from the blood.

Urine formation is a dynamic process involving filtration, selective reabsorption, and selective secretion along the nephron to maintain blood homeostasis.

# Summary: 13.3 Circulation and the Central Nervous System

This section discusses the protective coverings (meninges), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood supply (blood-brain barrier) of the central nervous system (CNS).

## Meninges:

*   Three connective tissue membranes covering and protecting the CNS, protecting blood vessels, containing CSF, and forming partitions within the skull.
*   **Layers (External to Internal):**
    1.  **Dura Mater:** Strongest, two-layered sheet of fibrous connective tissue.
        *   **Periosteal Layer:** Attaches to inner surface of skull (not present around spinal cord).
        *   **Meningeal Layer:** True external covering of brain; continues caudally in vertebral canal as spinal dura mater.
        *   Layers separate in certain areas to form **dural venous sinuses** (collect venous blood).
        *   Forms partitions (falx cerebri, falx cerebelli, tentorium cerebelli) that limit brain movement.
    2.  **Arachnoid Mater:** Middle layer with web-like extensions spanning the subarachnoid space.
        *   **Subarachnoid Space:** Between arachnoid and pia mater; contains CSF and largest blood vessels serving the brain.
        *   **Arachnoid Villi (Granulations):** Protrude through dura mater into superior sagittal sinus; absorb CSF into venous blood.
    3.  **Pia Mater:** Delicate connective tissue layer clinging tightly to the brain and spinal cord, following every convolution. Richly vascularized.

## Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):

*   Clear fluid similar in composition to blood plasma (less protein, different ion concentrations).
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Buoyancy:** Reduces brain weight, preventing it from crushing under its own weight.
    *   **Protection:** Cushions CNS from blows and trauma.
    *   **Chemical Stability:** Nourishes brain, carries chemical signals, removes waste products.
*   **Formation:** Produced by **choroid plexuses** located in the roof of each ventricle. These are capillaries surrounded by ependymal cells that filter fluid from blood.
*   **Circulation:** Flows from lateral ventricles -> third ventricle (via interventricular foramina) -> fourth ventricle (via cerebral aqueduct) -> subarachnoid space (via lateral/median apertures) and central canal of spinal cord. Circulates around brain and spinal cord. Absorbed into dural venous sinuses via arachnoid villi.

## Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB):

*   Protective mechanism maintaining a stable environment for the brain. Regulates passage of substances from blood into brain tissue.
*   **Structure:** Formed by:
    1.  Continuous endothelium of brain capillaries with tight junctions.
    2.  Thick basal lamina surrounding capillaries.
    3.  Feet of astrocytes clinging to capillaries.
*   **Function:** Selective barrier. Allows passage of essential substances (glucose, amino acids, electrolytes, oxygen, CO2) via facilitated diffusion/active transport. Blocks passage of metabolic wastes, proteins, toxins, most drugs. Ineffective against lipid-soluble substances (alcohol, nicotine, anesthetics).
*   Absent in some areas (e.g., vomiting center, hypothalamus) where monitoring of blood chemistry is necessary.

These protective structures ensure the physical and chemical stability required for proper CNS function.

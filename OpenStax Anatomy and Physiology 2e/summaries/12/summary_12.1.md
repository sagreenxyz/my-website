# Summary: 12.1 Basic Structure and Function of the Nervous System

This section introduces the nervous system as the body's master controlling and communicating system. It covers its basic functions and structural/functional divisions.

## Basic Functions:

*   **Sensation:** Monitoring changes (stimuli) inside and outside the body using sensory receptors. Sensory input.
*   **Integration:** Processing and interpreting sensory input and deciding what should be done. Occurs primarily in the CNS.
*   **Response:** Activating effector organs (muscles and glands) to cause a response. Motor output.

## Structural Divisions:

*   **Central Nervous System (CNS):**
    *   Consists of the brain and spinal cord.
    *   Located in the dorsal body cavity (cranial cavity and vertebral canal).
    *   Acts as the integrating and command center.
*   **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):**
    *   Consists of nerves (bundles of axons) extending from the brain (cranial nerves) and spinal cord (spinal nerves), and ganglia (collections of neuron cell bodies outside the CNS).
    *   Connects all parts of the body to the CNS.

## Functional Divisions (primarily PNS):

*   **Sensory (Afferent) Division:**
    *   Carries sensory information *from* receptors *towards* the CNS.
    *   **Somatic Sensory Fibers:** Convey impulses from skin, skeletal muscles, and joints.
    *   **Visceral Sensory Fibers:** Convey impulses from visceral organs (within ventral body cavity).
*   **Motor (Efferent) Division:**
    *   Transmits impulses *from* the CNS *to* effector organs (muscles and glands).
    *   **Somatic Nervous System (Voluntary):** Conducts impulses from CNS to *skeletal muscles*. Allows conscious control.
    *   **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) (Involuntary):** Conducts impulses from CNS to *smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands*. Regulates functions like heart rate, digestion, breathing.
        *   **Sympathetic Division:** Mobilizes body systems during activity ("fight or flight").
        *   **Parasympathetic Division:** Conserves energy, promotes housekeeping functions during rest ("rest and digest").

The nervous system provides rapid control and integration of body functions through electrical and chemical signals.

# Summary: 11.2 Naming Skeletal Muscles

This section explains the criteria and conventions used by anatomists to name skeletal muscles, making their identification and understanding easier. Muscle names often provide clues about their properties.

## Criteria for Naming Skeletal Muscles:

*   **Muscle Location:** Based on the body region or bone the muscle is near.
    *   *Example:* Tibialis anterior (anterior aspect of tibia), frontalis (over frontal bone).
*   **Muscle Shape:** Based on the geometric shape of the muscle.
    *   *Example:* Deltoid (triangular, like Greek letter delta), trapezius (trapezoid shape), serratus anterior (saw-toothed appearance), orbicularis oculi (circular).
*   **Muscle Size:** Uses terms like maximus (largest), minimus (smallest), longus (long), brevis (short), major (larger), minor (smaller).
    *   *Example:* Gluteus maximus, gluteus minimus, fibularis longus, fibularis brevis.
*   **Direction of Muscle Fibers:** Refers to the orientation of muscle fascicles relative to the body's midline or longitudinal axis of a limb.
    *   *Rectus:* Fibers run parallel to midline (e.g., rectus abdominis).
    *   *Transverse:* Fibers run perpendicular to midline (e.g., transversus abdominis).
    *   *Oblique:* Fibers run at an angle to midline (e.g., external oblique, internal oblique).
*   **Number of Origins:** Based on how many tendons of origin the muscle has.
    *   *Biceps:* Two origins (e.g., biceps brachii).
    *   *Triceps:* Three origins (e.g., triceps brachii).
    *   *Quadriceps:* Four origins (e.g., quadriceps femoris).
*   **Location of Attachments:** Names based on the origin and insertion points (origin usually named first).
    *   *Example:* Sternocleidomastoid (origins on sternum and clavicle, insertion on mastoid process).
*   **Muscle Action:** Named for the primary movement the muscle produces. Terms include flexor, extensor, adductor, abductor, levator, depressor, supinator, pronator, tensor.
    *   *Example:* Flexor carpi ulnaris (flexes wrist), adductor magnus (adducts thigh), levator scapulae (elevates scapula).

Often, multiple criteria are combined to create a unique muscle name (e.g., *extensor carpi radialis longus* indicates action, location, bone association, and size). Understanding these naming conventions aids in learning muscle anatomy and function.

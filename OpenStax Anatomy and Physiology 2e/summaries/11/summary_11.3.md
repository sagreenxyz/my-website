# Summary: 11.3 Axial Muscles of the Head, Neck, and Back

This section covers the axial muscles responsible for facial expression, mastication (chewing), eye movement, tongue movement, swallowing, neck movement, and vertebral column movement and stabilization.

## Muscles of Facial Expression:

*   **Origin:** Surface of the skull.
*   **Insertion:** Connective tissue and dermis of the skin.
*   **Function:** Create facial expressions by moving the skin. Examples include orbicularis oris (lips), orbicularis oculi (eyes), zygomaticus major/minor (smiling), buccinator (compresses cheek), frontalis (raises eyebrows).

## Muscles of Mastication (Chewing):

*   **Function:** Move the mandible at the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).
*   **Primary Muscles:** Masseter (elevation), temporalis (elevation, retraction), medial pterygoid (elevation, protraction, side-to-side), lateral pterygoid (depression, protraction, side-to-side).

## Extrinsic Eye Muscles:

*   **Origin:** Orbit walls.
*   **Insertion:** Outer surface of the eyeball (sclera).
*   **Function:** Control eye movements.
*   **Six Muscles:** Superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, lateral rectus, superior oblique, inferior oblique.

## Muscles of the Tongue:

*   **Extrinsic:** Originate outside the tongue, insert within it. Move the tongue's position (genioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus, palatoglossus).
*   **Intrinsic:** Originate and insert within the tongue. Change the tongue's shape.

## Muscles of the Anterior Neck:

*   **Function:** Assist in swallowing (deglutition) and speech by moving the hyoid bone and larynx.
*   **Suprahyoid Muscles:** Elevate hyoid, floor of mouth, and larynx during swallowing.
*   **Infrahyoid Muscles:** Depress hyoid and larynx during swallowing and speech.

## Muscles that Move the Head:

*   **Function:** Flex, extend, laterally flex, and rotate the head.
*   **Major Muscles:** Sternocleidomastoid (bilateral contraction flexes neck; unilateral contraction causes lateral flexion and contralateral rotation), scalenes (assist neck flexion/rotation, elevate ribs), splenius capitis/cervicis (extension, lateral flexion, ipsilateral rotation).

## Muscles of the Posterior Neck and the Back:

*   **Function:** Move and stabilize the vertebral column.
*   **Superficial:** Trapezius, latissimus dorsi (primarily move pectoral girdle/arm but cover back).
*   **Intermediate:** Serratus posterior superior/inferior (respiration).
*   **Deep (Intrinsic Back Muscles):** Maintain posture, control vertebral column movements.
    *   **Splenius Group:** (capitis, cervicis) - Extend, rotate head/neck.
    *   **Erector Spinae Group:** (iliocostalis, longissimus, spinalis) - Primary extensors of vertebral column; also lateral flexion.
    *   **Transversospinalis Group:** (semispinalis, multifidus, rotatores) - Deep to erector spinae; stabilize vertebrae, extension, rotation.
    *   **Segmental Group:** (interspinales, intertransversarii) - Short muscles between vertebrae; stabilize.
*   **Suboccipital Muscles:** Small group deep in posterior neck; fine movements of head.

# Summary: 11.4 Axial Muscles of the Abdominal Wall, and Thorax

This section focuses on the axial muscles located in the abdominal wall and the thorax, covering their roles in movement, posture, protection, and respiration.

## Muscles of the Abdominal Wall:

*   **Function:** Support and protect abdominal organs, compress abdomen (increasing intra-abdominal pressure for defecation, urination, childbirth, forced expiration), flex and rotate the trunk.
*   **Four Pairs:**
    *   **External Oblique:** Superficial, fibers run inferomedially. Compresses abdomen, flexes and rotates trunk (contralateral rotation).
    *   **Internal Oblique:** Deep to external oblique, fibers run superomedially. Compresses abdomen, flexes and rotates trunk (ipsilateral rotation).
    *   **Transversus Abdominis:** Deepest layer, fibers run horizontally. Compresses abdomen.
    *   **Rectus Abdominis:** Midline "strap" muscles enclosed in rectus sheath, segmented by tendinous intersections ("six-pack"). Flexes trunk, compresses abdomen. Linea alba is the midline tendinous seam.

## Muscles of the Thorax:

*   **Function:** Primarily involved in breathing, but also some trunk/upper limb movement.
*   **Muscles of Respiration:**
    *   **Diaphragm:** Dome-shaped muscle separating thoracic and abdominal cavities. Primary muscle of inspiration; contraction flattens it, increasing thoracic volume.
    *   **Intercostal Muscles:** Located between ribs.
        *   **External Intercostals:** Superficial, fibers run inferomedially. Elevate ribs during inspiration.
        *   **Internal Intercostals:** Deep, fibers run inferoposteriorly. Depress ribs during forced expiration.
        *   **Innermost Intercostals:** Deepest layer, assist internal intercostals.
    *   **Accessory Muscles:** Used during forced breathing (e.g., scalenes, sternocleidomastoid for inspiration; abdominal muscles, internal intercostals for expiration).
*   **Other Thoracic Muscles:** Pectoralis minor, serratus anterior (involved in pectoral girdle movement but located on thorax).

## Muscles of the Pelvic Floor and Perineum:

*   **Pelvic Floor (Pelvic Diaphragm):** Supports pelvic organs, controls defecation and urination (levator ani, coccygeus).
*   **Perineum:** Diamond-shaped region inferior to pelvic floor, containing external genitalia and associated muscles involved in urination, defecation, and sexual function (urogenital triangle and anal triangle muscles).

# Summary: 18.1 An Overview of Blood

This section provides an overview of blood composition and functions.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Function:** Blood transports nutrients, gases, and wastes; defends against infection; and regulates pH, temperature, and other conditions.
*   **Composition:** Blood consists of formed elements (erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets) suspended in plasma (fluid extracellular matrix).
*   **Plasma:** Over 90% water, containing plasma proteins (albumin, globulins, fibrinogen) and other solutes (glucose, lipids, electrolytes, gases).
*   **Characteristics:** Blood is viscous, slightly sticky, has a temperature slightly above body temperature (~38°C or 100.4°F), and a pH of approximately 7.4.

Blood is a vital fluid connective tissue essential for transport, defense, and maintaining homeostasis.

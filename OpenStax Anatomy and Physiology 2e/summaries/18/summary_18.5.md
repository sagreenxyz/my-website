# Summary: 18.5 Hemostasis

This section explains hemostasis, the physiological process that stops bleeding.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Hemostasis:** A rapid, localized, and carefully controlled process to prevent blood loss from damaged vessels.
*   **Three Stages:**
    1.  **Vascular Spasm:** Smooth muscle in the vessel wall contracts immediately upon injury, reducing blood flow. Triggered by direct injury, chemicals from endothelial cells and platelets, and pain reflexes.
    2.  **Platelet Plug Formation:** Platelets adhere to exposed collagen fibers at the injury site (adhesion), become activated (releasing chemicals like ADP, serotonin, thromboxane A2), and aggregate, forming a temporary plug. This is a positive feedback cycle.
    3.  **Coagulation (Blood Clotting):** A complex cascade of reactions involving clotting factors (most are plasma proteins synthesized by the liver, requiring vitamin K) that transforms blood from a liquid to a gel.
        *   *Pathways:* Intrinsic (triggered by factors within blood/vessel wall) and Extrinsic (triggered by tissue factor released from damaged tissue outside the vessel). Both pathways converge on a common pathway.
        *   *Common Pathway:* Leads to the formation of prothrombin activator, which converts prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then catalyzes the conversion of soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin strands, forming the meshwork of the clot.
*   **Clot Retraction and Repair:** Platelets contract, pulling fibrin strands and drawing vessel edges together. Growth factors stimulate cell division for repair.
*   **Fibrinolysis:** Gradual breakdown of the clot by plasmin (activated form of plasminogen) as healing occurs, restoring normal blood flow.
*   **Anticoagulants:** Mechanisms and substances (e.g., heparin, antithrombin) that limit clot formation and prevent spontaneous clotting.
*   **Disorders:** Thromboembolic disorders (undesirable clotting, e.g., thrombus, embolus), Bleeding disorders (inability to clot, e.g., hemophilia, thrombocytopenia).

Hemostasis involves vascular spasm, platelet plug formation, and coagulation to effectively seal damaged blood vessels.

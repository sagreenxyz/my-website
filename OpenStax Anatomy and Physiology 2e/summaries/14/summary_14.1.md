# Summary: 14.1 Sensory Perception

This section explores how sensory information is detected by receptors and processed into conscious awareness (perception).

## Sensation vs. Perception:

*   **Sensation:** The awareness of changes (stimuli) in the internal and external environment. Raw input.
*   **Perception:** The conscious interpretation of the meaning of stimuli. Occurs in the brain (cerebral cortex). Influenced by experience, context, emotional state.

## Sensory Receptors and Stimuli:

*   Sensory receptors respond to specific stimuli (the type of energy they are sensitive to - light, sound, pressure, chemical).
*   **Receptive Field:** The area monitored by a single receptor. Smaller receptive fields allow finer discrimination.
*   **Transduction:** Conversion of stimulus energy into a graded potential (receptor potential or generator potential) in the sensory receptor.
*   **Generator Potential:** Graded potential in a sensory neuron's dendrite; if it reaches threshold, triggers an AP in the sensory neuron.
*   **Receptor Potential:** Graded potential in a separate receptor cell; causes release of neurotransmitter onto a sensory neuron, which may then generate an AP.

## Sensory Processing Levels:

1.  **Receptor Level:** Sensory reception and transduction. Stimulus must match receptor specificity, occur within receptive field, be converted to graded potential, and reach threshold (if applicable) to generate APs.
    *   **Adaptation:** A change in sensitivity (usually decreased) in the presence of a constant stimulus. Receptors become less responsive.
        *   **Phasic Receptors:** Fast-adapting (e.g., touch, pressure, smell). Report changes in stimulus.
        *   **Tonic Receptors:** Slow-adapting or non-adapting (e.g., pain, proprioceptors). Provide sustained response; signal duration and intensity.
2.  **Circuit Level:** Processing in ascending pathways. Axons of first-order sensory neurons link receptor level to spinal cord/brainstem. Synapse with second-order neurons, which ascend to thalamus or cerebellum. Synapse with third-order neurons in thalamus, which project to somatosensory cortex. Pathways cross over (decussate).
3.  **Perceptual Level:** Processing in cortical sensory areas (somatosensory cortex in parietal lobe). Interpretation of sensory input.
    *   **Perceptual Detection:** Ability to detect that a stimulus has occurred (simplest level).
    *   **Magnitude Estimation:** Ability to detect how intense the stimulus is (coded by AP frequency).
    *   **Spatial Discrimination:** Identifying the site or pattern of stimulation (e.g., two-point discrimination). Depends on receptor density and receptive field size.
    *   **Feature Abstraction:** Neurons tuned to specific features (e.g., edges, shapes, textures). Complex patterns recognized by integrating input from multiple feature detectors.
    *   **Quality Discrimination:** Differentiating submodalities of a sensation (e.g., sweet vs. sour taste). Different receptors activated.
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Ability to recognize familiar patterns (e.g., face, melody).

Sensory perception involves a complex interplay of receptor activation, pathway transmission, and cortical interpretation.

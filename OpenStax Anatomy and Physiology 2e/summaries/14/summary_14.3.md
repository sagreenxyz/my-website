# Summary: 14.3 Motor Responses

This section describes how the CNS controls skeletal muscle movements, involving planning, initiation, and execution through descending motor pathways and modulation by other brain structures.

## Levels of Motor Control:

*   Motor control operates in a hierarchy, but with parallel processing and feedback loops.
1.  **Segmental Level (Spinal Cord):**
    *   Lowest level. Contains central pattern generators (CPGs) - circuits controlling locomotion and specific, repeated motor activities.
    *   Mediates spinal reflexes (e.g., stretch reflex, withdrawal reflex).
2.  **Projection Level (Brainstem & Motor Cortex):**
    *   Middle level. Conveys instructions to spinal cord motor neurons.
    *   **Upper Motor Neurons (UMNs):** Initiate direct (pyramidal) and indirect (extrapyramidal) pathways.
    *   **Direct (Pyramidal) Pathways:** Originate in primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus). Axons descend via corticospinal tracts. Control fine, skilled voluntary movements, especially of distal limbs. Decussate in medulla (lateral tract) or spinal cord (ventral tract).
    *   **Indirect (Extrapyramidal) Pathways:** Originate in brainstem nuclei (vestibular, reticular, superior colliculi, red nucleus). Influence axial muscles (balance, posture), coarse limb movements, head/neck/eye movements tracking objects. Modulate reflexes.
3.  **Precommand Level (Cerebellum & Basal Nuclei):**
    *   Highest level (in terms of coordination, not direct output). Regulate motor activity.
    *   **Cerebellum:** Acts as the coordinator. Receives intent to move from motor cortex and proprioceptive/visual/equilibrium feedback. Calculates best way to coordinate force, direction, extent of muscle contraction for smooth, precise movement. Corrects errors. Important for motor learning, balance, posture.
    *   **Basal Nuclei:** Receive input from cortex. Involved in starting/stopping movements, suppressing unwanted movements, regulating muscle tone, monitoring intensity of movements. Influence motor cortex via thalamus.

## Motor Areas of Cerebral Cortex:

*   Located in posterior frontal lobe.
*   **Primary Motor Cortex (Precentral Gyrus):** Contains large pyramidal neurons (UMNs) projecting via corticospinal tracts. Controls execution of voluntary movements. Exhibits somatotopy (motor homunculus - mapping of body regions; size proportional to dexterity).
*   **Premotor Cortex:** Anterior to precentral gyrus. Plans movements based on sensory input; selects and sequences basic motor actions into complex tasks. Coordinates movements of several muscle groups. Involved in imitation. Sends activating signals to primary motor cortex.
*   **Supplementary Motor Area (SMA):** Medial aspect of premotor cortex. Involved in planning complex sequences of movement, coordinating bilateral movements.
*   **Frontal Eye Field:** Controls voluntary eye movements.

Motor responses involve complex interactions between cortical planning areas, basal nuclei and cerebellar modulation, and execution via descending pathways acting on spinal cord circuits and lower motor neurons.

# Summary: 24.1 Overview of Metabolic Reactions

This section introduces the fundamental concepts of metabolism, including the distinction between catabolism and anabolism, the role of ATP, and the importance of redox reactions.

## Metabolism:

*   **Definition:** The sum of all chemical reactions occurring within the body.
*   **Two Main Categories:**
    1.  **Catabolism:** Breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones (e.g., digestion of food, breakdown of glucose). Releases energy. Exergonic reactions.
    2.  **Anabolism:** Synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones (e.g., building proteins from amino acids, synthesizing glycogen). Requires energy input. Endergonic reactions.
*   **Coupling:** Energy released from catabolic reactions is used to power anabolic reactions.

## Role of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate):

*   **Energy Currency:** ATP is the primary molecule used by cells to store and transfer energy for cellular activities.
*   **Structure:** Adenine base, ribose sugar, and three phosphate groups.
*   **Energy Release:** Energy is released when the terminal high-energy phosphate bond is broken, converting ATP to ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi).
    *   ATP â‡Œ ADP + Pi + Energy
*   **ATP Synthesis:** Energy released during catabolism (especially glucose oxidation) is captured to reattach a phosphate group to ADP, regenerating ATP. This occurs via:
    *   **Substrate-Level Phosphorylation:** Direct transfer of a high-energy phosphate group from a substrate molecule to ADP. Occurs in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle.
    *   **Oxidative Phosphorylation:** Indirect ATP formation involving the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis in the mitochondria. Requires oxygen and generates the majority of ATP.

## Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) Reactions:

*   **Core of Energy Metabolism:** Many metabolic reactions, especially those involved in energy release from food fuels, are redox reactions.
*   **Oxidation:** Loss of electrons (or hydrogen atoms); the oxidized substance loses energy.
*   **Reduction:** Gain of electrons (or hydrogen atoms); the reduced substance gains energy.
*   **Coupling:** Oxidation and reduction reactions are always coupled; one substance is oxidized while another is reduced.
*   **Role of Coenzymes:** Specific coenzymes act as electron (hydrogen) carriers, accepting electrons from oxidized substrates and donating them to other molecules.
    *   **NAD+ (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide):** Reduced to NADH + H+
    *   **FAD (Flavin adenine dinucleotide):** Reduced to FADH2
    *   These reduced coenzymes carry energy-rich electrons to the electron transport chain for ATP synthesis.

## Nutrient Processing:

*   Digested nutrients (glucose, fatty acids, amino acids) are absorbed and transported to cells.
*   Inside cells, these molecules are catabolized through various pathways (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, beta-oxidation) involving redox reactions to release energy, which is captured as ATP.
*   Alternatively, nutrients can be used anabolically to build cellular structures or stored for later use (glycogen, fat).

Metabolism encompasses the catabolic (energy-releasing) and anabolic (energy-requiring) reactions essential for life, centrally involving ATP as the energy currency and redox reactions for energy transfer.

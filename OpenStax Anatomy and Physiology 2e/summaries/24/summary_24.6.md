# Summary: 24.6 Energy and Heat Balance

This section explores how the body manages energy intake and expenditure, maintains a stable core body temperature, and the factors influencing metabolic rate.

## Energy Balance:

*   **Concept:** Energy intake (from food oxidation) = Energy output (heat + work + energy storage).
*   **Energy Intake:** Measured in kilocalories (kcal). Depends on the energy value of food (carbs/proteins ~4 kcal/g, fats ~9 kcal/g).
*   **Energy Output:**
    *   **Heat:** ~60% of energy from food is lost as heat during metabolic reactions. More heat is generated during muscle activity.
    *   **Work:** Energy used for cellular activities, muscle contraction, etc.
    *   **Energy Storage:** Excess energy stored primarily as fat (adipose tissue), some as glycogen.
*   **Weight Regulation:** Stable weight requires energy intake to equal output. Positive balance leads to weight gain; negative balance leads to weight loss. Regulation involves complex hormonal and neural signals (leptin, insulin, ghrelin, hypothalamic centers).

## Metabolic Rate:

*   **Definition:** The body's rate of energy expenditure per unit time. Total amount of heat produced by all chemical reactions and mechanical work.
*   **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):** Energy needed to perform essential activities (breathing, heart function) at rest, post-absorptive state, comfortable temperature. Measured indirectly via oxygen consumption.
    *   **Factors Influencing BMR:** Age (decreases), gender (higher in males), body surface area (higher with larger surface area), stress (increases), hormones (thyroxine is major determinant; increases BMR).
*   **Total Metabolic Rate (TMR):** Rate of kilocalorie consumption needed to fuel all ongoing activities (BMR + activity). Increases significantly with exercise, food ingestion (thermic effect of food), and environmental temperature changes.

## Body Temperature Regulation:

*   **Importance:** Core body temperature (~37°C or 98.6°F) must be kept relatively constant for optimal enzyme activity and metabolic function. Shell temperature (skin) fluctuates more.
*   **Heat Production:** Byproduct of metabolism (BMR, muscle activity, thyroxine effects, sympathetic stimulation).
*   **Heat Loss Mechanisms:**
    *   **Radiation:** Loss of heat as infrared waves.
    *   **Conduction:** Transfer of heat between objects in direct contact.
    *   **Convection:** Transfer of heat via movement of surrounding air or fluid.
    *   **Evaporation:** Heat loss as water evaporates from skin (sweat) and lungs. Only mechanism effective when environmental temperature is higher than body temperature.
*   **Role of Hypothalamus:** The body's thermostat. Contains heat-loss center and heat-promoting center. Receives input from peripheral (skin) and central (blood) thermoreceptors.
*   **Heat-Promoting Mechanisms (When Cold):** Vasoconstriction of cutaneous blood vessels, shivering (muscle contractions), increased metabolic rate (via epinephrine/norepinephrine, thyroxine), behavioral changes (adding clothes, seeking warmth).
*   **Heat-Loss Mechanisms (When Hot):** Vasodilation of cutaneous blood vessels, enhanced sweating (evaporation), behavioral changes (reducing activity, seeking shade/AC).
*   **Fever:** Controlled hyperthermia, often due to infection. Pyrogens reset the hypothalamic set point upwards.

Energy balance dictates body weight, while metabolic rate reflects energy expenditure. Precise thermoregulation, orchestrated by the hypothalamus, maintains core temperature through balancing heat production and loss.

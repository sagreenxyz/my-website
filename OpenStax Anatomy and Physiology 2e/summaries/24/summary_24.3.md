# Summary: 24.3 Lipid Metabolism

This section details how the body processes, stores, and utilizes lipids (fats), primarily triglycerides, for energy and other functions.

## Lipid Transport:

*   Lipids are hydrophobic and require transport proteins (lipoproteins) to move through blood.
*   **Chylomicrons:** Transport absorbed dietary lipids from the intestine to adipose tissue and liver.
*   **VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoproteins):** Transport triglycerides synthesized in the liver to adipose tissue for storage. Become LDLs after unloading triglycerides.
*   **LDL (Low-Density Lipoproteins):** Transport cholesterol to peripheral tissues for membranes, hormone synthesis, etc. High levels associated with atherosclerosis ("bad cholesterol").
*   **HDL (High-Density Lipoproteins):** Transport excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver for degradation/excretion. High levels considered protective ("good cholesterol").

## Lipid Catabolism (Lipolysis and Oxidation):

*   **Lipolysis:** Breakdown of stored triglycerides (in adipose tissue) into glycerol and fatty acids. Stimulated by hormones like epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, glucagon; inhibited by insulin.
*   **Glycerol Metabolism:** Glycerol is converted to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, an intermediate of glycolysis, and enters the pathway for ATP production or gluconeogenesis.
*   **Fatty Acid Metabolism (Beta-Oxidation):**
    *   Occurs in mitochondria.
    *   Fatty acids are broken down into 2-carbon acetic acid fragments, which fuse with CoA to form **acetyl-CoA**.
    *   Each cycle of beta-oxidation also produces reduced coenzymes (FADH2, NADH + H+).
    *   Acetyl-CoA enters the **Krebs cycle** for further oxidation and ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation (using the reduced coenzymes).
    *   Yields significantly more ATP per gram than carbohydrates or proteins.

## Ketogenesis:

*   **Process:** When acetyl-CoA production from beta-oxidation exceeds the Krebs cycle's capacity (e.g., during carbohydrate deficit/starvation, diabetes mellitus), the liver converts excess acetyl-CoA into **ketone bodies** (acetoacetic acid, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, acetone).
*   **Ketosis:** Accumulation of ketone bodies in the blood. Can be used as an alternative fuel source by tissues (including brain during prolonged fasting) but excessive levels (ketoacidosis) lower blood pH dangerously.

## Lipid Anabolism (Lipogenesis):

*   **Definition:** Synthesis of triglycerides from glycerol and fatty acids.
*   **Process:** Occurs when cellular ATP and glucose levels are high. Excess glucose or amino acids can be converted into acetyl-CoA, which is then used to synthesize fatty acids. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (from glycolysis) is converted to glycerol. Fatty acids and glycerol combine to form triglycerides.
*   **Location:** Primarily in liver and adipose tissue.
*   **Storage:** Triglycerides are stored in adipose tissue.

## Other Lipid Functions:

*   Synthesis of cholesterol (used for steroid hormones, bile salts, cell membranes).
*   Synthesis of phospholipids (cell membranes).
*   Providing essential fatty acids (linoleic, linolenic).
*   Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.

Lipid metabolism involves the breakdown of fats (lipolysis, beta-oxidation) for energy, synthesis of fats (lipogenesis) for storage, and transport via lipoproteins. It is crucial for energy balance and provides building blocks for various essential molecules.

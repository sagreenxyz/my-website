# Summary: 26.1 Body Fluids and Fluid Compartments

This section introduces the concept of body fluids, their distribution into different compartments, and their composition. Maintaining the distinct composition and volume of these compartments is crucial for homeostasis.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Body Water Content:** Varies with age, sex, and body fat percentage. Infants have the highest percentage, decreasing with age.
*   **Fluid Compartments:**
    *   **Intracellular Fluid (ICF):** Fluid within cells. Comprises about two-thirds of total body water. High concentration of potassium (K+), phosphate (PO43-), and proteins.
    *   **Extracellular Fluid (ECF):** Fluid outside cells. Comprises about one-third of total body water. Subdivided into:
        *   **Plasma:** Fluid component of blood.
        *   **Interstitial Fluid (IF):** Fluid in the spaces between cells. Includes lymph, CSF, synovial fluid, etc.
    *   ECF has high concentrations of sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-).
*   **Fluid Movement:** Water moves freely between compartments primarily via osmosis, driven by solute concentration gradients (osmolarity). Solutes generally require active transport or channels to move between compartments. Hydrostatic pressure also influences fluid movement, particularly between plasma and IF.

Understanding fluid compartments and their composition is fundamental to grasping fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance.

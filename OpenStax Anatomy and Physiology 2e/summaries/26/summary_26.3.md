# Summary: 26.3 Electrolyte Balance

This section focuses on the balance of key electrolytes (salts, acids, bases) in the body fluids, which are crucial for nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, membrane potential, and fluid balance.

## Major Electrolytes and Regulation:

*   **Sodium (Na+):** Major cation in ECF. Crucial for ECF volume, blood pressure, nerve/muscle function. Balance regulated primarily by **aldosterone** (increases Na+ reabsorption in kidneys) and **Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)** (decreases Na+ reabsorption). Water balance is closely linked (water follows salt).
*   **Potassium (K+):** Major cation in ICF. Essential for resting membrane potential, nerve/muscle excitability (especially cardiac). Regulated mainly by renal excretion, influenced by **aldosterone** (increases K+ secretion) and plasma K+ levels.
*   **Chloride (Cl-):** Major anion in ECF. Helps balance osmotic pressure and follows Na+. Reabsorbed passively or secondarily to Na+ transport.
*   **Calcium (Ca2+):** Important for bone structure, blood clotting, muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release. Regulated by **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)** (increases blood Ca2+ by stimulating bone resorption, kidney reabsorption, and intestinal absorption via Vitamin D activation) and **Calcitonin** (decreases blood Ca2+; minor role in humans).
*   **Phosphate (PO43-):** Important component of bones, nucleic acids, ATP, and buffer systems. Inverse relationship with Ca2+. Regulated primarily by **PTH** (decreases reabsorption) and renal excretion.
*   **Bicarbonate (HCO3-):** Key component of the bicarbonate buffer system (see 26.4). Regulated by kidneys (reabsorption/generation) and linked to CO2 levels via respiratory system.

Electrolyte balance is maintained primarily through renal mechanisms controlled by hormones, ensuring concentrations remain within narrow limits for proper physiological function.

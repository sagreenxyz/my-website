# Summary: 17.8 Gonadal and Placental Hormones

This section covers the steroid sex hormones produced by the gonads (ovaries and testes) and the temporary endocrine functions of the placenta.

## Gonadal Hormones:

*   Produce steroid sex hormones identical to those made by the adrenal cortex, but in much larger amounts.
*   Regulated by gonadotropins (FSH and LH) from the anterior pituitary, which are regulated by GnRH from the hypothalamus.

### Ovaries (Female Gonads):

*   Located in the pelvic cavity. Produce ova (eggs).
*   Produce two main steroid hormones:
    1.  **Estrogens (e.g., Estradiol):**
        *   Responsible for maturation of female reproductive organs.
        *   Appearance of secondary sex characteristics (breast development, fat distribution, wider pelvis).
        *   Regulate the menstrual cycle (with progesterone).
    2.  **Progesterone:**
        *   Works with estrogen to regulate the menstrual cycle.
        *   Promotes breast development.
        *   Maintains uterine lining during pregnancy.
*   Also produce inhibin (inhibits FSH release) and relaxin.

### Testes (Male Gonads):

*   Located in the scrotum. Produce sperm.
*   Produce primarily **Testosterone:**
    *   Initiates maturation of male reproductive organs.
    *   Appearance of secondary sex characteristics (body hair, deepening voice, increased muscle mass/bone density).
    *   Necessary for normal sperm production.
    *   Maintains reproductive organs in their functional state.
    *   Responsible for sex drive (libido).
*   Also produce inhibin (inhibits FSH release).

## Placental Hormones:

*   The placenta is a temporary endocrine organ formed during pregnancy.
*   Secretes several steroid and protein hormones that influence pregnancy:
    *   **Estrogens and Progesterone:** Maintain uterine lining, prevent menstruation, help prepare breasts for lactation. Secretion increases throughout pregnancy, taking over from the ovaries.
    *   **Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG):** Secreted early in pregnancy. Signals corpus luteum to continue producing estrogen/progesterone, preventing menstruation. Basis for pregnancy tests. Levels decline after first trimester as placenta takes over hormone production.
    *   **Human Placental Lactogen (hPL):** Helps prepare breasts for lactation, promotes fetal growth, exerts glucose-sparing effect in mother.
    *   **Relaxin:** Relaxes pelvic ligaments and pubic symphysis to ease birth passage.

Gonadal hormones are crucial for development and function of the reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. Placental hormones are essential for maintaining pregnancy and fetal development.

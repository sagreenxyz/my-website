# Summary: 17.7 The Pineal Gland

This section describes the small pineal gland and its primary hormone, melatonin.

## Anatomy and Location:

*   Small, pine cone-shaped gland located in the roof of the third ventricle in the brain (epithalamus).

## Hormone: Melatonin:

*   An amine hormone derived from serotonin.
*   **Function:** Primarily involved in regulating sleep-wake cycles (circadian rhythms).
    *   Concentrations rise and fall in a daily cycle: peak levels at night make us drowsy; lowest levels around noon.
    *   Receives indirect input from visual pathways regarding intensity and duration of daylight. Light exposure suppresses melatonin secretion.
*   **Other Possible Effects:** May influence timing of puberty (inhibitory effects on GnRH release), act as an antioxidant, affect body temperature regulation.
*   **Regulation:** Controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus (the "biological clock"), which responds to light input from the retina. Sympathetic pathways stimulate melatonin release in darkness.

The pineal gland, through melatonin secretion driven by light/dark cycles, plays a key role in regulating circadian rhythms, particularly sleep.

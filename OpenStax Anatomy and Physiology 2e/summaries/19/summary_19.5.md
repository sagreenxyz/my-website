# Summary: 19.5 Development of the Heart

This section outlines the embryonic development of the human heart.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Origin:** The heart is the first functional organ to develop, originating from mesoderm.
*   **Early Stages (Week 3):**
    *   Paired endothelial strands (cardiogenic cords) form in the cardiogenic area.
    *   These cords canalize to form two endocardial tubes.
    *   The tubes fuse medially to form a single primitive heart tube around day 21-22.
*   **Primitive Heart Tube Regions (Caudal to Cranial):** Consists of five distinct regions that will give rise to adult structures:
    1.  *Sinus Venosus:* Develops into the posterior portion of the right atrium, SA node, and coronary sinus.
    2.  *Primitive Atrium:* Develops into the anterior portions of the right and left atria (auricles) and part of the right atrium wall.
    3.  *Primitive Ventricle:* Develops into the left ventricle.
    4.  *Bulbus Cordis:* Develops into the right ventricle, pulmonary trunk, and aorta (proximal part).
    5.  *Truncus Arteriosus:* Develops into the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk.
*   **Cardiac Looping (Week 4):** The primitive heart tube elongates and folds upon itself (D-looping), establishing the basic spatial relationships of the future chambers (rightward bend).
*   **Chamber Septation (Weeks 4-7):** Internal partitions (septa) form to divide the heart into four chambers:
    *   *Atrial Septation:* Formation of septum primum and septum secundum, leaving the foramen ovale (an opening allowing blood to bypass pulmonary circulation).
    *   *Ventricular Septation:* Growth of the interventricular septum upwards from the floor of the ventricle.
    *   *Atrioventricular Canal Partitioning:* Endocardial cushions fuse, dividing the AV canal and forming the AV valves (tricuspid and mitral).
    *   *Outflow Tract Septation:* A spiral septum divides the truncus arteriosus and bulbus cordis into the aorta and pulmonary trunk, forming the semilunar valves.
*   **Fetal Circulation Shunts:** Structures allowing blood to bypass the non-functional fetal lungs:
    *   *Foramen Ovale:* Connects right and left atria.
    *   *Ductus Arteriosus:* Connects pulmonary trunk to the aorta.
*   **Postnatal Changes:** At birth, lung inflation and pressure changes cause closure of the foramen ovale (becomes fossa ovalis) and ductus arteriosus (becomes ligamentum arteriosum), establishing the adult pattern of circulation.
*   **Congenital Heart Defects:** Errors during development can lead to structural abnormalities (e.g., septal defects, valve stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot).

The heart develops from a simple tube through complex processes of looping and septation into a four-chambered organ by the end of the embryonic period.

# Summary: 19.3 Cardiac Cycle

This section describes the mechanical and electrical events occurring during one complete heartbeat, known as the cardiac cycle.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Cardiac Cycle:** The sequence of events from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. Includes both systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation) phases for both atria and ventricles.
*   **Phases (assuming ~75 bpm, cycle length ~0.8s):**
    1.  **Ventricular Filling (Mid-to-Late Diastole):**
        *   AV valves are open; SL valves are closed.
        *   Blood flows passively from atria into ventricles (~80% of filling).
        *   Atrial systole (P wave on ECG) occurs, pushing remaining blood into ventricles (atrial kick).
        *   Ventricles reach End Diastolic Volume (EDV).
    2.  **Ventricular Systole (Isovolumetric Contraction & Ejection):**
        *   *Isovolumetric Contraction:* Ventricles begin contracting (QRS complex on ECG), pressure rises rapidly, closing AV valves (first heart sound, "lub"). Volume remains constant as SL valves are still closed.
        *   *Ventricular Ejection:* Ventricular pressure exceeds pressure in aorta/pulmonary trunk, forcing SL valves open. Blood is ejected into arteries.
        *   Ventricles reach End Systolic Volume (ESV).
    3.  **Isovolumetric Relaxation (Early Diastole):**
        *   Ventricles relax (T wave on ECG), pressure falls.
        *   Blood flows back towards ventricles, closing SL valves (second heart sound, "dub").
        *   AV valves remain closed; volume is constant (isovolumetric).
        *   When ventricular pressure drops below atrial pressure, AV valves open, restarting the cycle.
*   **Pressure Changes:** Blood flows down pressure gradients. Ventricular pressure changes drive the opening and closing of valves and the movement of blood. Aortic pressure fluctuates but remains high.
*   **Heart Sounds:** Associated with the closing of heart valves.
    *   *S1 ("lub"):* Closure of AV valves at the beginning of ventricular systole.
    *   *S2 ("dub"):* Closure of SL valves at the beginning of ventricular diastole.
    *   Murmurs: Abnormal sounds often indicating valve problems (stenosis or insufficiency).
*   **Volumes:**
    *   *End Diastolic Volume (EDV):* Volume in ventricle at end of diastole.
    *   *End Systolic Volume (ESV):* Volume in ventricle at end of systole.
    *   *Stroke Volume (SV):* Volume ejected per beat (SV = EDV - ESV).

The cardiac cycle involves coordinated pressure and volume changes within the heart chambers, driven by muscle contraction/relaxation and regulated by valve action, resulting in the pumping of blood.

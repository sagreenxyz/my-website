        "explanation": "Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an increase in blood pH due to an excess of bicarbonate or a loss of metabolic acids. The body will attempt to compensate by increasing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) through hypoventilation to lower the pH back towards normal. Therefore, increased pH, increased pCO2 (as compensation), and increased HCO3– are characteristic of metabolic alkalosis."

        "options": [
          "oxidation–reduction reaction",
          "anabolic reaction",
          "catabolic reaction",
          "biosynthetic reaction"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "catabolic reaction",
        "explanation": "A polysaccharide is a complex carbohydrate made up of many monosaccharide units linked together. The breakdown of a polysaccharide into its constituent monosaccharides is a catabolic reaction, specifically hydrolysis, which releases energy."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "weight gain",
        "explanation": "Anabolic reactions build larger molecules from smaller ones, requiring energy, while catabolic reactions break down larger molecules, releasing energy. If the rate of anabolism exceeds catabolism, the body is building and storing more energy than it is using, leading to weight gain."

          "the electron transport chain",
          "glycolysis"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "the electron transport chain",
        "explanation": "The electron transport chain, coupled with oxidative phosphorylation, produces the vast majority of ATP molecules (approximately 32-34) during aerobic cellular respiration from one molecule of glucose. Glycolysis yields a net of 2 ATP, the Krebs cycle produces 2 ATP (or GTP), and lactic acid fermentation does not produce any additional ATP beyond glycolysis."

          "ATP and H2O"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "ATP and H2O",
        "explanation": "Aerobic cellular respiration, the complete oxidation of glucose in the presence of oxygen, results in the production of ATP (the main energy currency of the cell), carbon dioxide, and water (H2O). NADH and FADH2 are electron carriers used in the process, and pyruvate is an intermediate product of glycolysis."

          "broken down into energy for the body",
          "stored as triglycerides for later use",
          "converted into acetyl CoA",
          "all of the above"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "all of the above",
        "explanation": "Dietary lipids (fats) can be catabolized through beta-oxidation to produce acetyl CoA, which can then enter the Krebs cycle for ATP production. Lipids can also be stored in adipose tissue as triglycerides for later energy use, and excess carbohydrates and proteins can also be converted into triglycerides for storage."

          "cholesterol",
          "proteins",
          "bile salts"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "bile salts",
        "explanation": "The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver. Bile contains bile salts, which emulsify fats in the small intestine, breaking them into smaller droplets and forming micelles. Micelles are essential for the transport of digested lipids (fatty acids and monoglycerides) across the intestinal brush border membrane for absorption."

        "question_number": 12,
        "question_text": "Triglycerides are transported by chylomicrons because ________.",
        "options": [
          "they cannot move easily in the blood stream because they are fat based, while the blood is water based",
          "they are too small to move by themselves",
          "the chylomicrons contain enzymes they need for anabolism",
          "they cannot fit across the intestinal membrane"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "they cannot move easily in the blood stream because they are fat based, while the blood is water based",
        "explanation": "Triglycerides are nonpolar and hydrophobic, meaning they do not dissolve well in the aqueous environment of the blood. To be transported in the bloodstream, they are packaged into lipoproteins called chylomicrons, which have an outer shell that is hydrophilic (water-soluble), allowing them to travel through the blood."

          "FADH2",
          "triglycerides",
          "NADH"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "triglycerides",
        "explanation": "Triglycerides (fats) yield the most ATP per gram when metabolized compared to carbohydrates (like glucose) and proteins due to their higher proportion of carbon-hydrogen bonds, which store more energy. NADH and FADH2 are electron carriers that contribute to ATP production but are not directly metabolized for energy in the same way as triglycerides or carbohydrates."

          "acetyl CoA",
          "monoglycerides",
          "ketone bodies"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "acetyl CoA",
        "explanation": "Acetyl CoA is the primary molecule that enters the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle). It is derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates (glucose via pyruvate), lipids (fatty acids), and proteins (some amino acids)."
      },

          "fatty acids",
          "polysaccharides",
          "triglycerides"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "polysaccharides",
        "explanation": "Acetyl CoA is a central intermediate in metabolism. It can be converted to ketone bodies (during ketogenesis), fatty acids (for lipid synthesis), and triglycerides (for fat storage after fatty acid synthesis). However, in animals, acetyl CoA cannot be directly converted back to pyruvate, and therefore cannot be used to synthesize glucose and subsequently polysaccharides like glycogen."

          "stomach; pepsin; HCl; amino acids"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "stomach; pepsin; HCl; amino acids",
        "explanation": "The digestion of proteins begins in the stomach, where the enzyme pepsin, which is activated by hydrochloric acid (HCl), mixes with food to start breaking down proteins into smaller peptides. The process is completed into amino acids in the small intestine."

          "supply energy for the cell",
          "create red blood cells"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "build new proteins",
        "explanation": "Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are essential for the synthesis of new proteins in the body, which have a wide range of functions including structural support, enzymes, hormones, and antibodies. Amino acids can also be used for energy or converted to glucose or fat if needed."

          "converted to nitrogen",
          "stored to be used later"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "converted to acetyl CoA",
        "explanation": "If amino acids are not used for protein synthesis, they can be deaminated (the amino group is removed), and the remaining carbon skeleton can be converted into intermediates of cellular respiration, such as acetyl CoA or components of the Krebs cycle. These can then be used for ATP production or converted to glucose or ketones."

          "high; low; stay the same",
          "low; low; stay the same",
          "high; high; are high",
          "high; high; are low"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "high; high; are low",
        "explanation": "The absorptive state occurs after a meal when glucose from digested food enters the bloodstream, causing blood glucose levels to rise. This stimulates the pancreas to release insulin, which promotes glucose uptake by cells and its conversion to glycogen for storage, while also inhibiting the release of glucagon."

          "insulin, glucose, and glucagon",
          "insulin and ketones"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "glucagon and insulin",
        "explanation": "During starvation, blood glucose levels drop significantly. This triggers a decrease in insulin secretion and an increase in glucagon secretion. Glucagon promotes the release of glucose from stored glycogen in the liver and the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (gluconeogenesis) to raise blood glucose levels."

          "glycogen; liver",
          "glucose; liver"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "glycogen; liver",
        "explanation": "The postabsorptive state occurs when the digestive tract is empty, and the body relies on its stored energy reserves to maintain blood glucose levels. The liver stores glycogen, which is broken down into glucose (glycogenolysis) and released into the bloodstream to provide energy for cells."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "convection",
        "explanation": "In a crowded room, people release heat, warming the air around them. This warm air becomes less dense and rises, while cooler air descends, creating currents that distribute heat throughout the room. This process of heat transfer through the movement of fluids (in this case, air) is called convection."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "active transport",
        "explanation": "Active transport processes require energy (usually ATP) to move substances across the cell membrane, often against their concentration gradient. Ion pumps move ions against their gradient, and phagocytosis involves the cell engulfing large particles, both requiring energy."

        "explanation": "Diffusion is a general term for the movement of solutes down their concentration gradient. Osmosis is a specific type of diffusion involving the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane. Endocytosis is a general term for bringing substances into the cell. Pinocytosis is a specific type of endocytosis involving the ingestion of fluids (cell drinking)."

        "correct_answer": "the pool water containing chlorine",
        "explanation": "The cytoplasm is the entire contents of a cell within the plasma membrane, excluding the nucleus. The cytosol is the fluid portion of the cytoplasm. In the analogy, the swimming pool is like the cell, the pool water containing chlorine is like the cytosol (the fluid component), and the flotation toys are like the organelles."

          "the production of cellular energy"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "a double cell membrane",
        "explanation": "Both the nucleus and mitochondria are enclosed by a double membrane. The nucleus has nuclear pores, and mitochondria have pores in their inner membrane, but the double membrane is a more general shared feature. Ribosomes are synthesized in the nucleolus (within the nucleus), and mitochondria have their own ribosomes for their own protein synthesis, but they don't synthesize the main cellular ribosomes. Energy production is primarily the function of mitochondria."

        "correct_answer": "CGAATATA",
        "explanation": "In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). Therefore, the complementary sequence to GCTTATAT is CGAATATA."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "attaching complementary nucleotides to the template strand",
        "explanation": "During the elongation step of DNA synthesis, DNA polymerase moves along the template strand, adding complementary nucleotides to the growing daughter strand."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "endocardium",
        "explanation": "Chordae tendineae and papillary muscles work together with the atrioventricular (AV) valves to prevent backflow of blood from the ventricles into the atria during ventricular contraction. The endocardium is the inner lining of the heart chambers and does not directly prevent backflow."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "mitral",
        "explanation": "The mitral valve, also known as the bicuspid valve, is located between the left atrium and the left ventricle, preventing backflow of blood from the ventricle into the atrium."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "tricuspid, pulmonary semilunar, bicuspid, aortic semilunar",
        "explanation": "Deoxygenated blood from the systemic circuit enters the right atrium via the vena cava, flows through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, then through the pulmonary semilunar valve into the pulmonary trunk. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium, flows through the bicuspid (mitral) valve into the left ventricle, and finally through the aortic semilunar valve into the aorta."

        "correct_answer": "endocardium",
        "explanation": "The endocardium, the innermost lining of the heart chambers, is composed of simple squamous epithelium called endothelium. These endothelial cells secrete various substances, including endothelin, which is a powerful vasoconstrictor, and other chemicals that help regulate the ionic environment and contraction of the heart."

          "right ventricle"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "left ventricle",
        "explanation": "The myocardium, the muscular layer of the heart, is thickest in the left ventricle because it must generate the high pressure required to pump oxygenated blood to the entire systemic circulation against greater resistance."

          "atrioventricular septum",
          "all of the above"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "interatrial septum",
        "explanation": "In the adult heart, the interatrial septum, which separates the left and right atria, normally has no openings. However, during fetal development, the foramen ovale allows blood to bypass the non-functional lungs by flowing directly from the right atrium to the left atrium. This opening typically closes after birth, leaving a depression called the fossa ovalis."

          "Only cardiac muscle is capable of autorhythmicity",
          "Only cardiac muscle has a high concentration of mitochondria."
        ],
        "correct_answer": "Only cardiac muscle has gap junctions.",
        "explanation": "While cardiac muscle exhibits autorhythmicity (the ability to generate its own electrical impulses) and has a high concentration of mitochondria, it also shares these features with some smooth muscle cells. However, the extensive presence of gap junctions, which allow for rapid electrical communication between adjacent cardiac muscle cells, enabling the heart to function as a syncytium, is a unique characteristic compared to skeletal muscle."

          "potassium",
          "chloride",
          "calcium"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "calcium",
        "explanation": "The action potential of cardiac muscle cells is characterized by a plateau phase, which is primarily due to the influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) through slow calcium channels in the sarcolemma. This influx balances the efflux of potassium ions, prolonging the depolarization of the membrane."

          "T wave",
          "none of the above: atrial repolarization is masked by ventricular depolarization"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "none of the above: atrial repolarization is masked by ventricular depolarization",
        "explanation": "The P wave on an electrocardiogram (ECG) represents atrial depolarization. The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization, and the T wave represents ventricular repolarization. Atrial repolarization occurs but is typically masked by the larger electrical activity of ventricular depolarization, making it difficult to see on a standard ECG."

          "bundle branches",
          "Purkinje fibers"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "atrioventricular node",
        "explanation": "The sinoatrial (SA) node has the fastest rate of spontaneous depolarization, initiating the heartbeat. The atrioventricular (AV) node also has autorhythmicity but fires at a slower rate than the SA node, creating a slight delay that allows for atrial contraction before ventricular contraction. The AV bundle, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers have progressively faster firing rates than the AV node but slower than the SA node."

        "question_text": "The cardiac cycle consists of a distinct relaxation and contraction phase. Which term is typically used to refer ventricular contraction while no blood is being ejected?",

          "diastole",
          "quiescent",
          "isovolumic contraction"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "isovolumic contraction",
        "explanation": "Isovolumic contraction is a specific phase of ventricular systole where the ventricles begin to contract, increasing pressure, but both the atrioventricular (AV) valves and the semilunar valves are closed, so there is no change in ventricular volume and no blood is ejected yet. Systole refers to the entire period of ventricular contraction."

          "ventricular systole",
          "isovolumic contraction"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "atrial diastole",
        "explanation": "The majority of ventricular filling (about 80%) occurs passively during ventricular diastole when the atrioventricular (AV) valves are open, allowing blood to flow from the atria into the ventricles. Atrial systole contributes the remaining 20% by actively pushing blood into the ventricles."

          "closing of the atrioventricular valves",
          "closing of the semilunar valves"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "closing of the atrioventricular valves",
        "explanation": "The first heart sound (S1 or 'lub') is produced by the turbulent flow of blood created by the closure of the atrioventricular (AV) valves (tricuspid and mitral) at the beginning of ventricular systole."

          "ventricular depolarization",
          "atrial repolarization"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "ventricular repolarization",
        "explanation": "Ventricular relaxation (diastole) begins immediately after ventricular repolarization, which is the return of the ventricular muscle cells to their resting electrical state. On an electrocardiogram (ECG), ventricular repolarization is represented by the T wave, which occurs after the QRS complex (ventricular depolarization)."

          "cardiac output",
          "stroke volume"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "afterload",
        "explanation": "Afterload refers to the resistance that the ventricles must overcome to eject blood into the aorta (from the left ventricle) and the pulmonary trunk (from the right ventricle). It is the pressure in the arteries that the heart has to work against."

          "It remains constant.",
          "There is no way to predict."
        ],
        "correct_answer": "It decreases.",
        "explanation": "Cardiac output is the product of heart rate and stroke volume. While an increase in heart rate generally increases cardiac output, if the heart rate becomes too rapid (typically above 160-180 bpm), there is less time for the ventricles to fill with blood during diastole. This can lead to a decrease in stroke volume, and if the decrease in stroke volume is significant enough, it can outweigh the increase in heart rate, resulting in a net decrease in cardiac output."

          "It remains constant.",
          "There is no way to predict."
        ],
        "correct_answer": "It increases.",
        "explanation": "Preload refers to the degree of stretch of the ventricular muscle fibers at the end of diastole, which is directly related to the volume of blood in the ventricles at that time (end-diastolic volume). Venous constriction increases venous return to the heart, leading to a greater volume of blood filling the ventricles during diastole and thus increasing preload."

          "both Na+ and K+"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "Ca2+",
        "explanation": "An inotrope is a substance that affects the contractility of the heart muscle. A positive inotrope increases the force of contraction. Calcium ions (Ca2+) play a crucial role in the excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle cells. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration leads to stronger and more forceful contractions."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "Adenylyl cyclase will not be activated.",
        "explanation": "Many hormones exert their effects by binding to cell surface receptors that are coupled to G proteins. Activation of the G protein often leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), a second messenger. If the G protein is prevented from activation, adenylyl cyclase will not be stimulated, and cAMP levels will not rise."

          "all of the above"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "all of the above",
        "explanation": "The thyroid gland is located in the anterior neck, inferior to the larynx and anterior to the trachea. The parathyroid glands are embedded in the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland produces three main hormones: thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and calcitonin."

        "correct_answer": "there is hypertrophy of the thyroid’s follicle cells",
        "explanation": "A goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. It can be caused by various conditions, including iodine deficiency, which leads to decreased production of thyroid hormones. This triggers increased secretion of TSH, resulting in hypertrophy (enlargement) of the thyroid follicle cells as they attempt to produce more hormone."

                "explanation": "Membrane transport includes passive transport (diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis), which doesn't require energy and moves substances down their concentration gradient, and active transport (ion pumps, endocytosis, exocytosis like phagocytosis), which requires energy (ATP) to move substances against their concentration gradient or transport large molecules."

The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is studded with ribosomes, giving it a 'rough' appearance. Lysosomes are organelles containing digestive enzymes that break down waste materials and cellular debris. The Golgi apparatus is an organelle responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion or delivery to other organelles."

                "correct_answer": "They are all polymers of protein subunits.",
                "explanation": "The cytoskeleton consists of three types of protein filaments: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. Microfilaments are polymers of actin subunits. Intermediate filaments are polymers of various fibrous proteins (like keratin, vimentin, neurofilaments). Microtubules are polymers of tubulin subunits. Therefore, a common feature is that they are all polymers formed from protein subunits."

                "correct_answer": "a double cell membrane",
                "explanation": "Both the nucleus and mitochondria are unique among cellular organelles in that they are enclosed by a double membrane (an inner and an outer membrane). The nucleus has nuclear pores, but mitochondria do not have the same type of protein-lined pores. Mitochondria are the primary sites of ATP production (cellular energy), while the nucleus is not. Ribosome synthesis occurs in the nucleolus within the nucleus, not in mitochondria (although mitochondria contain their own ribosomes)."

                "correct_answer": "CGAATATA",
                "explanation": "In DNA, base pairing rules dictate that Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) always pairs with Cytosine (C). To find the complementary sequence for GCTTATAT, you replace each base with its pair: G pairs with C, C pairs with G, T pairs with A, and A pairs with T. Therefore, the complementary sequence is CGAATATA."

                "correct_answer": "G1",
                "explanation": "The cell cycle's Interphase includes G1, S, and G2 phases. G1 (Gap 1) is the phase of cell growth and preparation for DNA replication; the cell synthesizes proteins and organelles needed for DNA synthesis. S phase is when DNA synthesis (replication) actually occurs. G2 (Gap 2) involves further growth and preparation for mitosis. G0 is a resting phase where cells are not actively preparing to divide. Therefore, G1 is the phase specifically characterized by preparation for DNA synthesis."

                "explanation": "The genetic code is read in groups of three nucleotide bases in messenger RNA (mRNA). Each sequence of three bases, called a codon, specifies a particular amino acid (or a start/stop signal) during protein synthesis. For example, the codon AUG codes for the amino acid methionine and also serves as the start codon."

                ],
                "correct_answer": "fRNA",
                "explanation": "The three main types of RNA involved in protein synthesis are: messenger RNA (mRNA), which carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosome; transfer RNA (tRNA), which brings the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome; and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which is a structural component of the ribosome itself and catalyzes peptide bond formation. fRNA is not a recognized standard type of RNA involved in this process."

                "correct_answer": "attaching complementary nucleotides to the template strand",
                "explanation": "DNA synthesis (replication) occurs in three main steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. Initiation involves unwinding the DNA helix and separating the two strands (done by helicase). Elongation is the phase where DNA polymerase enzymes move along each template strand and add complementary nucleotides (A with T, G with C), building the new DNA strands. Termination is the completion of the process. Therefore, attaching complementary nucleotides is the key event of the elongation step."

                "explanation": "The organization of genetic material follows a hierarchy of increasing complexity: 1. DNA: The fundamental double helix molecule. 2. Nucleosome: DNA wraps around a core of histone proteins, forming a 'bead-on-a-string' structure. 3. Chromatin: Nucleosomes are further coiled and folded, forming a more compact structure called chromatin fiber. 4. Chromosome: During cell division, chromatin condenses significantly to form visible chromosomes, the most complex level of organization."

                "correct_answer": "facilitated diffusion",
                "explanation": "Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport that uses membrane proteins (channels or carriers) to help substances move across the membrane down their concentration gradient. Unlike simple diffusion, which involves substances moving directly across the lipid bilayer, facilitated diffusion is required for substances that are too large, polar, or charged to pass through easily. It does not require cellular energy (ATP)."

These cells can differentiate into various cell types (like bone, cartilage, fat, blood cells). Parents sometimes bank these cells at birth or when teeth are shed as a potential source for future regenerative medicine therapies for the child or compatible family members, although clinical applications are still evolving."

Therefore, increasing specialization means decreasing potency, ordered as pluripotency, multipotency, oligopotency, unipotency."

                "explanation": "Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids composed of nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. Both DNA and RNA have a backbone made of alternating sugar and phosphate molecules. Key differences include: the sugar (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA), the bases (DNA uses Thymine (T), RNA uses Uracil (U)), and structure (DNA is typically a double helix, RNA is typically single-stranded). The statement that RNA does not contain sugars is incorrect; it contains ribose sugar."

Anaphase is the third stage where the separation of sister chromatids occurs.

It is involved in various functions, including cell movement (locomotion), intracellular transport, and cell division. Cytoplasm refers to the entire cell contents within the membrane excluding the nucleus, cytosol is the fluid portion of the cytoplasm, and the nuclear envelope is the membrane surrounding the nucleus."

                "explanation": "Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is caused by rapid exposure to low oxygen levels at high altitude. Exercise increases oxygen demand. While low PO2 is the root cause, exercise exacerbates AMS symptoms because the already limited oxygen supply is consumed faster, depleting the venous oxygen reserve more quickly and leading to greater tissue hypoxia."

                "explanation": "Residual volume (RV) is the amount of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal expiration.

                "correct_answer": "Male and female offspring have the same likelihood of inheriting the disease.",
                "explanation": "Autosomal inheritance means the gene is located on a non-sex chromosome. Autosomal dominant means only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to express the trait. Therefore, males and females have an equal chance (typically 50% if one parent is affected) of inheriting the condition."

A relative decrease in progesterone's influence (or a shift in the estrogen-to-progesterone ratio) near term makes the uterus more sensitive to oxytocin and prostaglandins, facilitating the onset of labor contractions."

* Mechanisms of cellular and tissue dysfunction in genetic diseases are varied but can be similar to nonheritable disorders.
    * Example: Bone fracture healing in osteoporosis vs. osteogenesis imperfecta.
    * Example: Response to coronary atherosclerosis, regardless of LDL receptor inheritance.
* Pathophysiologic principles in genetic disease focus on:
    * Mechanisms of mutation.
    * Inheritance patterns.
    * Molecular pathways from genotype to phenotype.
* This chapter will cover:
    * Terminology for inherited conditions.
    * Prevalence of genetic disease.
    * Major principles and considerations in medical genetics (key terms in Table 2-1).
* Discussion of disorders caused by collagen gene mutations (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta):
    * Osteogenesis imperfecta:
        * Often considered a single entity, but different mutations and genes lead to a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes.
        * Exhibits autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance (mendelian conditions).
* Phenylketonuria as an example of a mendelian condition to show how environmental factors influence genotype-phenotype relationship.
    * Serves as a paradigm for newborn screening and treatment of genetic disease.
* Nontraditional inheritance patterns:
    * Conditions dependent on the inherited gene and the phenotype or sex of the parent.
    * Example: Fragile X–associated mental retardation syndrome.
        * Most common inherited cause of mental retardation.
        * Illustrates how different mutation types explain genetic anticipation (severity progressing with generations).
    * Disorders affecting the mitochondrial genome, dependent on parental phenotype and sex. As examples,
        * Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).
        * Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF).
        * Illustrates principles of mitochondrial inheritance and pathophysiology.
* Aneuploidy as a common type of human genetic disease:
    * Alters normal chromosome content per cell without affecting DNA structure.
    * Example: Down syndrome.
        * Major impact on reproductive medicine and decision making.
        * Illustrates general principles applicable to many aneuploid conditions.
* Advances in genome sequencing:
    * Completion of the human genome sequence.
    * Rapid and inexpensive sequencing of individual genomes.
    * Prospects for identifying genetic components of human phenotypes.
    * Enables truly personalized medical care.
* UNIQUE PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC ASPECTS OF GENETIC DISEASES:
    * Primary cause: Change in DNA sequence or cellular content, deranging gene expression.
    * Most common cause: Alteration in DNA sequence affecting a single gene product.
    * Other causes:
        * Structural rearrangements (deletion/duplication of gene groups).
        * Abnormalities in mitosis/meiosis (abnormal chromosome number).
    * Mutation inheritance and presence:
        * Typically, every cell in an affected individual carries the mutation (inherited via a mutant gamete).
        * "New mutation": Arises during gamete development; parent's somatic cells are unaffected.
        * Mosaicism: Mutation arises during early embryogenesis, leading to a mixture of mutant and nonmutant cells.
            * Germline mosaicism: Mutation in some germ cells.
            * Somatic mosaicism: Mutation in some somatic cells.
            * Or both.
    * Key Terminology:
        * Gene: A short DNA stretch (usually <100,000 bp) encoding a product (typically protein) for a measurable trait.
        * DNA length: Measured in base pairs (bp), kilobase pairs (kb), or megabase pairs (Mb). Chromosomes range from ~46 Mb to ~245 Mb.
        * Locus: The specific location of a gene on a chromosome.
        * Alleles: Variant DNA sequences of a gene found among individuals.
        * Mutation: A biochemical event (e.g., nucleotide change, deletion, insertion) that produces a new allele.
            * Not all mutations alter the gene product's structure or expression (e.g., changes in introns, third "wobble" codon position).
            * All mutations result in a biochemical/molecular phenotype (a change in DNA).
            * Only some mutations lead to a clinically abnormal phenotype.
    * Variant Alleles - Molecular Level:
        * Usually identified by DNA sequencing.
        * Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP): A change in a single base pair.
        * Polymorphism: Originally an allele present in ≥1% of the population; now often described qualitatively (e.g., rare vs. common variants).
    * Variant Alleles - Clinical Level:
        * Recognized by their effect on a phenotype (e.g., HLA type, hair color).
    * Autosomal Genes (on chromosomes 1-22, two copies per cell):
        * Homozygous: An individual carries identical copies of an allele.
        * Heterozygous: An individual carries two different alleles.
        * These terms can apply to DNA sequence, protein product, or clinical phenotype.
            * Example: An individual can be heterozygous for a SNP with no protein change, a deletion causing disease, or a DNA alteration changing protein structure without causing disease.
    * Phenotype: Any characteristic that can be measured.
        * Examples:
            * Readily apparent (not necessarily disease-related): Hair color, height.
            * Disease phenotypes (requiring clinical investigation): Diabetes, coronary artery disease.
            * Molecular biologic phenotypes (detectable by lab tests): Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLPs), SNPs.

There are two critically important aspects of adaptive immunity. The first is specificity, while the second is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

[22](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167660618941-solution). 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ immunity involves the production of antibody molecules that bind to specific antigens.

[23](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167660600411-solution). 

The heavy chains of an antibody molecule contain \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ region segments, which help to determine its class or isotype.

[24](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167662361349-solution). 

The variable regions of the heavy and light chains form the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ sites of an antibody.

[25](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167660667582-solution). 

MHC molecules are used for antigen \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to T cells.

[26](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167662393493-solution). 

MHC II molecules are made up of two subunits (α and β) of approximately equal size, whereas MHC I molecules consist of a larger α subunit and a smaller subunit called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

[27](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167660320036-solution). 

A \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ T cell will become activated by presentation of foreign antigen associated with an MHC I molecule.

[28](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167662484621-solution). 

A \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ T cell will become activated by presentation of foreign antigen in association with an MHC II molecule.

[29](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167660341840-solution). 

A TCR is a protein dimer embedded in the plasma membrane of a T cell. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ region of each of the two protein chains is what gives it the capability to bind to a presented antigen.

[30](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167662489665-solution). 

Peripheral tolerance mechanisms function on T cells after they mature and exit the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

[31](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167660187342-solution). 

Both \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and effector T cells are produced during differentiation of activated T cells.

[32](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167661351066-solution). 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ antigens can stimulate B cells to become activated but require cytokine assistance delivered by helper T cells.

[33](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167659189165-solution). 

T-independent antigens can stimulate B cells to become activated and secrete antibodies without assistance from helper T cells. These antigens possess \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ antigenic epitopes that cross-link BCRs.

[34](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167662497363-solution). 

A(n) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ pathogen is in a weakened state; it is still capable of stimulating an immune response but does not cause a disease.

[35](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167662916044-solution). 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ immunity occurs when antibodies from one individual are harvested and given to another to protect against disease or treat active disease.

[36](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-18#fs-id1167662615323-solution). 

In the practice of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, scabs from smallpox victims were used to immunize susceptible individuals against smallpox.

Match the antibody class with its description.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| \_\_\_IgA | A. This class of antibody is the only one that can cross the placenta. |
| \_\_\_IgD | B. This class of antibody is the first to appear after activation of B cells. |
| \_\_\_IgE | C. This class of antibody is involved in the defense against parasitic infections and involved in allergic responses. |
| \_\_\_IgG | D. This class of antibody is found in very large amounts in mucus secretions. |

Match each type of vaccine with the corresponding example.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| \_\_\_inactivated vaccine | A. Weakened influenza virions that can only replicate in the slightly lower temperatures of the nasal passages are sprayed into the nose. They do not cause serious flu symptoms, but still produce an active infection that induces a protective adaptive immune response. |
| \_\_\_live attenuated vaccine | B. Tetanus toxin molecules are harvested and chemically treated to render them harmless. They are then injected into a patient’s arm. |
| \_\_\_toxoid vaccine | C. Influenza virus particles grown in chicken eggs are harvested and chemically treated to render them noninfectious. These immunogenic particles are then purified and packaged and administered as an injection. |
| \_\_\_subunit vaccine | D. The gene for hepatitis B virus surface antigen is inserted into a yeast genome. The modified yeast is grown and the virus protein is produced, harvested, purified, and used in a vaccine. |

A person steps on a rusty nail and develops tetanus. In this case, the person has acquired a(n) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ disease.

[17](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-15#fs-id1167585822266-solution). 

A(n) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ pathogen causes disease only when conditions are favorable for the microorganism because of transfer to an inappropriate body site or weakened immunity in an individual.

The concentration of pathogen needed to kill 50% of an infected group of test animals is the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

[19](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-15#fs-id1167585789977-solution). 

A(n) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ infection is a small region of infection from which a pathogen may move to another part of the body to establish a second infection.

Cilia, fimbriae, and pili are all examples of structures used by microbes for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

[21](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-15#fs-id1167584961254-solution). 

The glycoprotein adhesion gp120 on HIV must interact with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ on some immune cells as the first step in the process of infecting the cell.

[22](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-15#fs-id1167583882735-solution). 

Adhesins are usually located on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of the pathogen and are composed mainly of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

The Shiga and diphtheria toxins target \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in host cells.

[24](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-15#fs-id1167584771056-solution). 

Antigenic \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is the result of reassortment of genes responsible for the production of influenza virus spike proteins between different virus particles while in the same host, whereas antigenic \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is the result of point mutations in the spike proteins.

[25](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-15#fs-id1167583625948-solution). 

*Candida* can invade tissue by producing the exoenzymes \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

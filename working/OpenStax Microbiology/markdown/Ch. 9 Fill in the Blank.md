*Staphylococcus aureus* can be grown on multipurpose growth medium or on mannitol salt agar that contains 7.5% NaCl. The bacterium is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

[40](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-9#fs-id1172102050321-solution). 

Blood agar contains many unspecified nutrients, supports the growth of a large number of bacteria, and allows differentiation of bacteria according to hemolysis (breakdown of blood). The medium is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

[41](https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/chapter-9#fs-id1172101889254-solution). 

Rogosa agar contains yeast extract. The pH is adjusted to 5.2 and discourages the growth of many microorganisms; however, all the colonies look similar. The medium is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

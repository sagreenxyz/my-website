# Summary: 7.5 Using Biochemistry to Identify Microorganisms

This section discusses various biochemical methods used in clinical microbiology laboratories to identify bacterial isolates, which is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and managing disease outbreaks. These methods rely on detecting phenotypic biochemical characteristics or analyzing metabolic capabilities.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Importance of Accurate Identification:**
    *   Essential for informing treatment decisions (e.g., food poisoning, disease outbreaks).
    *   Allows appropriate strategies for epidemic containment.
*   **Methods for Identification:**
    *   **Phenotypic Biochemical Characteristics:** Analyzing nutritional and metabolic capabilities.
    *   **Genotypic Identification:** (Mentioned but not detailed in this excerpt).
*   **Detection of Biosynthesis Products:**
    *   **Cytoplasmic Granules:** Some microorganisms store compounds as granules, which can be used for identification.
        *   Example: Poly-Î²-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules in some *Pseudomonas* species. Presence/absence of PHB and fluorescent pigments helps classify *Pseudomonas* spp. (*P. aeruginosa* and *P. syringae* are fluorescent and do not accumulate PHB).
*   **Biochemical Reaction Panels:**
    *   **Traditional Methods:** Limited number of test tubes for assays (e.g., carbon utilization, metabolic tests).
    *   **Modern Systems (e.g., Biolog, Inc.):**
        *   Use panels of numerous biochemical reactions performed simultaneously.
        *   Identify cells based on their ability to metabolize certain biochemicals and physiological properties (pH, chemical sensitivity).
        *   Analyzed by software; can be manual, semi-automated, or fully automated.
    *   **API (Analytical Profile Index) Strips:**
        *   Contain miniaturized biochemical tests in cupules.
        *   Inoculated with bacterial suspension; color changes indicate metabolic activity.
        *   Results generate a profile number matched to a database for identification.
*   **Mass Spectrometry for Identification:**
    *   **MALDI-TOF (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry):**
        *   Rapid and cost-effective method.
        *   **Process:**
            1.  Microorganism mixed with a specialized matrix reagent on a MALDI plate.
            2.  Irradiated with a pulsed UV laser, generating gaseous ions from microbial chemical constituents.
            3.  Ions accelerated through a mass spectrometer; travel velocity depends on mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).
            4.  Detector records ion arrival times, generating a mass spectrum unique to the organism's biochemical composition.
            5.  Mass spectrum compared to a database of known spectra for identification.
*   **Proteomic Analysis:**
    *   Study of all accumulated proteins of an organism (proteome).
    *   Can be used to identify bacteria by analyzing their protein profiles under various conditions.
    *   Techniques include mass spectrometry to identify proteins separated by HPLC or gel electrophoresis.
*   **Clinical Focus Link:**
    *   Refers back to a previous Clinical Focus box, implying the application of these identification methods in a clinical scenario.

# Summary: 7.4 Proteins

This section describes proteins, which are highly diverse macromolecules derived from amino acids. It covers the fundamental structure of amino acids, how they bond to form peptide chains (proteins), and the different levels of protein structure that determine their wide array of functions.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Importance and Functions of Proteins:**
    *   Derived from amino acids, capable of forming molecules of various sizes and properties.
    *   Perform numerous vital functions:
        *   Structural components of cells and subcellular entities.
        *   Sources of nutrients.
        *   Atom- and energy-storage reservoirs.
        *   Functional species: hormones, enzymes, receptors, transport molecules.
*   **Amino Acids:**
    *   Organic molecules with a central carbon (α carbon) bonded to:
        1.  A hydrogen atom (H)
        2.  A carboxyl group (–COOH)
        3.  An amino group (–NH<sub>2</sub>)
        4.  A variable **R group** (residue or side chain) - this group defines the specific amino acid.
    *   There are 20 common amino acids used to build proteins.
    *   R groups vary in size, shape, charge, and hydrophobicity, determining the amino acid's chemical properties.
*   **Peptide Bonds:**
    *   Amino acids are linked together by **peptide bonds** formed via dehydration synthesis between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another.
    *   A chain of amino acids is a **peptide** or **polypeptide**.
    *   **Protein:** Typically refers to a polypeptide or multiple polypeptides that have folded into a specific three-dimensional shape and have a biological function.
*   **Levels of Protein Structure:** The unique characteristics of R groups allow for various interactions (hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide bonds, hydrophobic interactions) that determine protein folding and structure.
    *   **Primary Structure:**
        *   The linear sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.
        *   Determined by the gene encoding the protein.
    *   **Secondary Structure:**
        *   Localized folding of the polypeptide chain into regular patterns.
        *   Common structures:
            *   **α-helix:** Coiled, spiral structure stabilized by hydrogen bonds between C=O and N-H groups in the polypeptide backbone.
            *   **β-pleated sheet:** Sheet-like structure formed by hydrogen bonds between segments of the polypeptide chain lying side-by-side.
    *   **Tertiary Structure:**
        *   The overall three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain.
        *   Determined by interactions between R groups (hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges between cysteine residues).
        *   Crucial for protein function.
    *   **Quaternary Structure (in some proteins):**
        *   The arrangement of multiple polypeptide subunits (each with its own tertiary structure) to form a functional protein complex.
        *   Subunits are held together by the same types of interactions as in tertiary structure.
        *   Example: Hemoglobin (four subunits).
*   **Protein Denaturation:**
    *   Loss of the protein's native three-dimensional structure (secondary, tertiary, and quaternary levels) due to disruption of bonds (e.g., by heat, pH changes, chemicals).
    *   Often results in loss of function.
    *   Primary structure (sequence of amino acids) usually remains intact.
*   **Conjugated Proteins (mentioned in context of protein diversity):**
    *   Proteins that contain a non-protein component (prosthetic group).
    *   Examples: Glycoproteins (carbohydrate attached), lipoproteins (lipid attached).
*   **Cystic Fibrosis:**
    *   Mentioned as an example of a disease related to protein misfolding (CFTR protein).

# Summary: 7.1 Organic Molecules

This section introduces the fundamental concepts of biochemistry and organic chemistry relevant to life, focusing on the elements common in living cells, the structure of carbon-based molecules, isomerism, and the importance of functional groups in forming polymers.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Biochemistry and Organic Chemistry:**
    *   **Biochemistry:** Studies the chemistry of life, explaining form and function based on chemical principles.
    *   **Organic Chemistry:** Study of carbon-based chemistry, the foundation for biomolecules.
*   **Elements in Living Cells:**
    *   **Macronutrients (CHONPS):** Hydrogen (H), Carbon (C), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Sulfur (S) account for ~99% of cell dry weight.
    *   **Micronutrients (Trace Elements):** Required in small amounts (e.g., Na, K, Mg, Zn, Fe, Ca, Mo, Cu, Co, Mn, V). Essential for many biochemical reactions.
    *   **Bonding:** Light elements (C, N, O, H) form strong covalent bonds. Carbon forms four bonds, nitrogen three, oxygen two, hydrogen one. Lone pairs of electrons on O, S, N influence molecular properties.
*   **Carbon Skeleton and Isomerism:**
    *   Carbon atoms can bond to form chains, branched structures, or rings, creating diverse carbon skeletons.
    *   **Isomers:** Molecules with the same chemical formula but different structures and properties.
        *   **Structural Isomers:** Differ in the covalent arrangement of atoms (e.g., glucose, fructose, galactose are C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> but differ in atom arrangement).
        *   **Stereoisomers:** Isomers with the same structural formula but different spatial arrangements of atoms.
            *   **Enantiomers:** Stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (e.g., D-glucose and L-glucose). Living systems often exhibit specificity for one enantiomer.
*   **Functional Groups:**
    *   Specific groups of atoms within molecules responsible for characteristic chemical reactions.
    *   Important in forming polymers by linking monomers.
    *   Examples (though not detailed in this excerpt, implied by learning objectives): hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, sulfhydryl groups.
*   **Biologically Important Molecules (Overview):**
    *   Large molecules (macromolecules) are often polymers built from smaller repeating units (monomers).
    *   **Dehydration Synthesis (Condensation Reaction):** Monomers combine to form polymers by releasing a water molecule.
    *   **Hydrolysis:** Polymers are broken down into monomers by the addition of a water molecule.
*   **Clinical Focus: Part 1**
    *   **Scenario:** Penny, a 16-year-old, develops an itchy skin rash (allergic eczema) after switching sunscreens.
    *   **Treatment:** Avoid offending sunscreen; use over-the-counter moisturizing cream.
    *   **Questions Posed:** What substances are in moisturizing cream? What properties help alleviate itching/inflammation? (Suggests discussion of lipids, emollients, anti-inflammatory agents).
*   **Question Posed in Text:**
    *   What is the byproduct of a dehydration synthesis reaction? (Answer: Water).

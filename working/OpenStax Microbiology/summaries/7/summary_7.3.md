# Summary: 7.3 Lipids

This section describes lipids, a diverse group of hydrophobic biomolecules. It covers their chemical composition, unique characteristics, diverse structures (fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, steroids, isoprenoids), and their roles in nutrient storage, energy storage, cell structure (membranes), and hormones.

## Key Concepts:

*   **General Characteristics of Lipids:**
    *   Composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen; may also contain oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus.
    *   Hydrophobic ("water-fearing") or nonpolar.
    *   Diverse functions: nutrient source, carbon storage, energy storage, structural components of membranes, hormones.
*   **Fatty Acids:**
    *   Long-chain hydrocarbons terminated with a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).
    *   **Saturated Fatty Acids:** Contain only single C-C bonds; straight, flexible chains; typically solid at room temperature (e.g., animal fats).
    *   **Unsaturated Fatty Acids:** Contain one or more double C=C bonds; have "kinks" or bends in their chains; typically liquid at room temperature (e.g., plant oils).
        *   **Monounsaturated:** One double bond.
        *   **Polyunsaturated:** Multiple double bonds.
*   **Triacylglycerides (Triglycerides):**
    *   Formed by three fatty acids chemically linked to a glycerol molecule via ester bonds (dehydration synthesis).
    *   Primary components of adipose tissue (body fat) and sebum (skin oils).
    *   Efficient energy-storage molecules (more than double the caloric content of carbohydrates/proteins).
*   **Phospholipids:**
    *   Composed of a glycerol backbone, two fatty acid chains, and a phosphate group modified by an alcohol.
    *   **Amphipathic:** Have a hydrophobic tail (fatty acids) and a hydrophilic head (phosphate group).
    *   Major structural component of biological membranes (plasma membranes, organelle membranes).
    *   Form **lipid bilayers** in aqueous environments, with hydrophobic tails facing inward and hydrophilic heads facing outward.
    *   Can also form micelles (spherical structures).
*   **Isoprenoids (Terpenoids):**
    *   Branched lipids formed from five-carbon isoprene units.
    *   Found in many plants, algae, and fungi.
    *   Diverse functions: pigments (e.g., carotenoids), fragrances (e.g., limonene, menthol), components of essential oils, vitamins (e.g., vitamin E, vitamin K), natural rubber.
    *   Involved in prokaryotic cell membrane and cell wall synthesis.
*   **Steroids (Sterols):**
    *   Complex, ringed structures with four fused carbon rings.
    *   Hydrophobic and insoluble in water.
    *   Many have a short tail and a hydroxyl (-OH) group (making them sterols).
    *   **Cholesterol:** Most common sterol in animal tissues; structural component of animal cell membranes (maintains fluidity); precursor to steroid hormones (e.g., testosterone, estrogen) and vitamin D.
    *   **Hopanoids:** Structurally similar to cholesterol; found in bacterial membranes, help stabilize them.
    *   **Ergosterol:** Found in fungal cell membranes (target for antifungal drugs).
*   **Biological Membranes:**
    *   Phospholipid bilayers form the fundamental structure.
    *   Fluid mosaic model: membranes are dynamic, with proteins and other lipids (e.g., cholesterol, hopanoids) embedded or associated.

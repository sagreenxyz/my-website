# Summary: 7.2 Carbohydrates

This section describes carbohydrates, the most abundant biomolecules on Earth. It covers their chemical composition, classification (monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides), structure, and diverse functions within cells, including energy storage and structural roles.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Definition and Composition:**
    *   Primarily a combination of carbon and water; empirical formula often (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>.
    *   Contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; some also have nitrogen, phosphorus, and/or sulfur.
    *   Often called **saccharides** (from Greek *sakcharon*, meaning sugar).
*   **Functions of Carbohydrates:**
    *   Food sources.
    *   Vital parts of macromolecular structures (DNA, RNA).
    *   Basis of structural polymers (cellulose, chitin).
    *   Primary source of energy storage (starch, glycogen).
*   **Monosaccharides (Simple Sugars):**
    *   Building blocks (monomers) for complex carbohydrates.
    *   Classified by the number of carbons (e.g., triose - 3C, tetrose - 4C, pentose - 5C, hexose - 6C). Suffix "-ose" indicates a saccharide.
    *   **Examples of Hexoses (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>):**
        *   **Glucose:** Most abundant monosaccharide in nature; primary energy source.
        *   **Galactose:** Part of lactose (milk sugar).
        *   **Fructose:** Fruit sugar.
        *   These are structural isomers.
    *   Can exist as linear chains or ring structures (more common in aqueous solutions).
    *   Enantiomers (e.g., D-glucose and L-glucose) exist, with D-forms being most common in nature.
*   **Disaccharides:**
    *   Formed when two monosaccharides bond via a **glycosidic bond** (a type of covalent bond) through dehydration synthesis.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Sucrose (Table Sugar):** Glucose + Fructose.
        *   **Lactose (Milk Sugar):** Glucose + Galactose.
        *   **Maltose (Malt Sugar):** Glucose + Glucose.
*   **Polysaccharides (Glycans):**
    *   Large polymers composed of hundreds or thousands of monosaccharide units linked by glycosidic bonds.
    *   Can be straight-chained or branched.
    *   **Examples and Functions:**
        *   **Starch:** Energy storage polymer in plants (composed of amylose and amylopectin, polymers of glucose).
        *   **Glycogen:** Energy storage polymer in animals and bacteria (highly branched polymer of glucose).
        *   **Cellulose:** Structural component of plant cell walls (linear polymer of glucose with Î²-1,4 glycosidic bonds). Most abundant organic polymer. Provides dietary fiber.
        *   **Chitin:** Structural polymer found in fungal cell walls and arthropod exoskeletons (polymer of N-acetylglucosamine).
        *   **Peptidoglycan (Murein):** Structural component of bacterial cell walls (complex polysaccharide with peptide cross-links).
*   **Question Posed in Text:**
    *   What are the most biologically important polysaccharides and why are they important? (Answer: Starch, glycogen for energy storage; cellulose, chitin, peptidoglycan for structural support).

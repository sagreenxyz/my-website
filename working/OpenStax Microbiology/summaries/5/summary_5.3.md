# Summary: 5.3 Fungi

This section provides an overview of fungi, a diverse group of heterotrophic, typically saprozoic organisms. It covers their unique characteristics, modes of reproduction, major groups, and their medical and ecological importance, including pathogenic fungi and those beneficial to humans.

## Key Concepts:

*   **General Characteristics of Fungi:**
    *   Eukaryotic, heterotrophic (mostly saprozoic - absorb nutrients from dead organic matter).
    *   Included in microbiology because many unicellular yeasts and spores are microscopic.
    *   Cell walls contain **chitin**.
    *   Cell membranes contain **ergosterols** (target for antifungal drugs).
    *   Can be unicellular (yeasts) or multicellular (molds).
*   **Morphology:**
    *   **Molds (Multicellular Fungi):**
        *   Composed of filaments called **hyphae**.
        *   **Mycelium:** A tangled network of hyphae.
        *   **Thallus:** Body of a fleshy fungus.
        *   **Septate Hyphae:** Hyphae with walls (septa) between cells.
        *   **Nonseptate (Coenocytic) Hyphae:** Hyphae lacking walls and cell membranes between cells.
    *   **Yeasts (Unicellular Fungi):**
        *   Typically round or oval.
        *   Reproduce asexually by budding. Some form pseudohyphae.
    *   **Dimorphic Fungi:** Can grow as either yeast or mold depending on environmental conditions (e.g., temperature). Many pathogenic fungi are dimorphic.
*   **Reproduction:**
    *   **Asexual Reproduction:**
        *   Mitosis followed by budding (yeasts).
        *   Fragmentation of hyphae.
        *   Formation of asexual spores (e.g., conidiospores, sporangiospores).
    *   **Sexual Reproduction:**
        *   Involves plasmogamy (fusion of cytoplasm), karyogamy (fusion of nuclei), and meiosis to form sexual spores (e.g., zygospores, ascospores, basidiospores).
*   **Importance of Fungi:**
    *   **Medical Relevance:**
        *   **Mycoses:** Illnesses caused by fungi.
        *   **Pathogenic Fungi:** Some are primary pathogens; others are opportunistic (infect immunocompromised hosts).
        *   Examples: *Candida albicans* (candidiasis), *Aspergillus* spp. (aspergillosis), *Cryptococcus neoformans* (cryptococcosis).
        *   Some produce **mycotoxins** (e.g., aflatoxins by *Aspergillus flavus*).
    *   **Ecological Roles:** Decomposers, nutrient cycling.
    *   **Beneficial Uses:**
        *   Food production (e.g., mushrooms, cheeses, bread, alcoholic beverages - *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*).
        *   Source of antibiotics (e.g., penicillin from *Penicillium*).
        *   Research tools (e.g., *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* as a model eukaryote).
*   **Major Groups of Fungi (Phyla):**
    *   **Ascomycota (Sac Fungi):**
        *   Produce sexual spores (ascospores) in a sac-like structure called an ascus.
        *   Includes edible mushrooms (morels, truffles), yeasts (*Saccharomyces*, *Candida*), molds (*Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*), and many plant pathogens.
    *   **Basidiomycota (Club Fungi):**
        *   Produce sexual spores (basidiospores) on club-shaped structures called basidia.
        *   Includes most familiar mushrooms, puffballs, shelf fungi, rusts, and smuts.
        *   Example: *Cryptococcus neoformans*.
    *   **Microsporidia:**
        *   Unicellular, obligate intracellular parasites.
        *   Lack mitochondria, peroxisomes, and centrioles.
        *   Produce polar tubules to pierce host cells.
        *   Example: *Enterocytozoon bieneusi* (causes diarrhea).
    *   **Zygomycota (Conjugated Fungi - traditional grouping, now revised):**
        *   Mostly saprophytic, coenocytic hyphae.
        *   Produce sexual spores (zygospores) after conjugation.
        *   Example: *Rhizopus stolonifer* (bread mold).

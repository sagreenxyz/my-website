# Summary: 5.2 Parasitic Helminths

This section discusses parasitic helminths (worms), which are included in microbiology because their eggs and larvae are often microscopic and used for identification. It covers the two major groups: Nematoda (roundworms) and Platyhelminthes (flatworms), detailing their morphology, life cycles, and examples of human pathogens.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Parasitic Helminths:**
    *   Multicellular animals with organ systems.
    *   Parasitic species often have limited digestive tracts, nervous systems, and locomotor abilities.
    *   Complex reproductive cycles, sometimes involving multiple hosts and life stages.
    *   **Monoecious:** Have both male and female reproductive organs.
    *   **Dioecious:** Have separate male and female individuals.
    *   Studied in microbiology due to microscopic eggs and larvae.
*   **Nematoda (Roundworms):**
    *   Phylum Nematoda; diverse group (>15,000 species).
    *   Unsegmented worms with a full digestive system.
    *   Eggs often identifiable in feces or around the anus.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   ***Ascaris lumbricoides*:** Large intestinal roundworm; widespread; causes ascariasis (mild cough/abdominal pain to severe intestinal blockage/impaired growth). Infection via ingestion of eggs.
        *   ***Enterobius vermicularis* (Pinworm):** Common, causes enterobiasis (perianal itching). Infective eggs.
        *   ***Necator americanus* and *Ancylostoma duodenale* (Hookworms):** Infective larvae penetrate skin; cause iron deficiency anemia.
        *   ***Trichinella spiralis*:** Causes trichinellosis; acquired from undercooked meat containing larvae.
        *   ***Dirofilaria immitis* (Heartworm):** Primarily affects dogs and cats; transmitted by mosquitoes.
*   **Platyhelminthes (Flatworms):**
    *   **Flukes (Trematodes):**
        *   Nonsegmented flatworms with an oral sucker (and sometimes a ventral sucker) for attachment.
        *   Complex life cycles, often involving multiple hosts (e.g., snails as intermediate hosts).
        *   Examples:
            *   *Schistosoma* spp.: Cause schistosomiasis (bilharzia); larvae penetrate skin in contaminated water. Affects liver, intestines, bladder.
            *   *Clonorchis* and *Opisthorchis* spp. (Liver flukes): Acquired from undercooked fish.
            *   *Fasciolopsis buski* (Intestinal fluke).
            *   *Paragonimus westermani* (Lung fluke).
    *   **Tapeworms (Cestodes):**
        *   Segmented flatworms.
        *   Body consists of a **scolex** (head region with suckers/hooks for attachment) and **proglottids** (segments containing reproductive structures).
        *   Lack a digestive system; absorb nutrients through their cuticle.
        *   Often require an intermediate host.
        *   Examples:
            *   *Taenia saginata* (Beef tapeworm): Acquired from undercooked beef.
            *   *Taenia solium* (Pork tapeworm): Acquired from undercooked pork. Can cause cysticercosis if eggs are ingested.
            *   *Diphyllobothrium latum* (Fish tapeworm): Largest human tapeworm.
            *   *Echinococcus granulosus* (Dog tapeworm): Can cause hydatid disease in humans (intermediate hosts).
*   **Global Burden:**
    *   Soil-transmitted helminth infections are a major global health problem, particularly in developing countries.
    *   Neglected tropical diseases include many helminth infections.

# Summary: 5.4 Algae

This section describes algae, which are autotrophic protists included in microbiology due to their microscopic forms and ecological significance. It covers their unique characteristics, diversity, classification into major groups, and examples, including toxin-producing algae.

## Key Concepts:

*   **General Characteristics of Algae:**
    *   Autotrophic protists (perform photosynthesis).
    *   Can be unicellular or multicellular.
    *   Found in supergroups Chromalveolata and Archaeplastida.
    *   Ecologically important: produce ~70% of oxygen and organic matter in aquatic environments.
    *   Source of food for humans/animals, and products like agar, agarose, carrageenan.
    *   Typically not pathogenic, but some produce toxins leading to **harmful algal blooms (HABs)**.
*   **Cell Structure:**
    *   Complex cell structures.
    *   One or more chloroplasts (site of photosynthesis) which may contain **pyrenoids** (synthesize/store starch).
    *   Chloroplast membrane number varies (2, 3, or 4), indicating primary or secondary endosymbiotic events.
    *   Different algal groups have different photosynthetic pigments (e.g., chlorophylls, carotenoids, phycobilins), reflected in common names (red, brown, green algae).
*   **Distinctions:**
    *   **Seaweeds (Macroscopic Algae):** Can be red, brown, or green. Lack true tissues, organs, and waxy cuticle of land plants.
    *   **Cyanobacteria (Blue-Green Algae):** Prokaryotic, distinct from eukaryotic algae despite photosynthetic capabilities.
*   **Reproduction:**
    *   Asexual (mitosis) or sexual (using gametes).
    *   Variety of life cycles.
*   **Algal Diversity and Major Groups:**
    *   **Chromalveolata:**
        *   **Dinoflagellates:**
            *   Mostly marine, component of plankton.
            *   Phototrophic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic.
            *   Photosynthetic pigments: chlorophyll *a*, chlorophyll *c*2.
            *   Typically two flagella (cause whirling motion).
            *   Some have cellulose plates (theca).
            *   Some produce neurotoxins (e.g., *Gonyaulax*, *Alexandrium* cause paralytic shellfish poisoning; *Pfiesteria piscicida* is a "fish killer").
            *   Dense populations can cause **red tides** (a type of HAB).
        *   **Stramenopiles:**
            *   **Diatoms (Bacillariophyta):** Unicellular, cell walls of silica (frustules). Major component of phytoplankton. Store products as oils. Some produce domoic acid (neurotoxin causing amnesic shellfish poisoning).
            *   **Golden Algae (Chrysophyta):** Mostly freshwater, unicellular. Use carotenoids.
            *   **Brown Algae (Phaeophyta):** Mostly marine seaweeds (e.g., kelp, *Laminaria*). Multicellular.
    *   **Archaeplastida:**
        *   **Red Algae (Rhodophyta):**
            *   Mostly multicellular seaweeds.
            *   Cell walls contain agar or carrageenan.
            *   Photosynthetic pigments: chlorophyll *a*, phycobilins (phycoerythrin gives red color).
        *   **Green Algae (Chlorophyta):**
            *   Diverse group (unicellular, colonial, filamentous, multicellular).
            *   Photosynthetic pigments: chlorophyll *a*, chlorophyll *b* (similar to land plants).
            *   Store carbohydrates as starch.
            *   Considered ancestors of land plants.
            *   Examples: *Chlamydomonas*, *Volvox*, *Ulva* (sea lettuce), *Spirogyra*.
    *   **Excavata (Euglenozoa):**
        *   Includes photosynthetic organisms (e.g., *Euglena*), but not always considered "true" algae as they can be motile and heterotrophic.
        *   *Euglena* spp.: Typically unicellular, have flagella, a stigma (eyespot), and chloroplasts (if present). Can be mixotrophic.
*   **Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs):**
    *   Rapid growth of algae producing dense populations.
    *   Can produce high concentrations of toxins impairing liver/nervous system function in aquatic animals and humans.
    *   Associated groups: Dinoflagellates, Diatoms.

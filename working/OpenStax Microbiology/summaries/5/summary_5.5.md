# Summary: 5.5 Lichens

This section describes lichens as symbiotic associations between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner (alga or cyanobacterium). It covers their unique characteristics, the roles of each partner, their ecological importance, and benefits to the environment.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Definition of a Lichen:**
    *   A composite organism arising from a symbiotic relationship between a **fungus** (the mycobiont, usually an Ascomycete) and a **photosynthetic partner** (the photobiont, either a green alga or a cyanobacterium).
*   **Symbiotic Relationship:**
    *   Often considered **controlled parasitism** by the fungus on the photobiont, as the photosynthetic organism may grow less well than it would alone. However, it can also be viewed as **mutualistic** to some extent:
        *   **Fungus benefits:** Obtains photosynthates (carbohydrates) from the photobiont.
        *   **Photobiont benefits:** Can grow in drier, more exposed environments than it could alone, protected by the fungal hyphae.
*   **Characteristics of Lichens:**
    *   Found on diverse surfaces (rocks, tree bark, soil).
    *   Slow-growing and can live for centuries.
    *   **Thallus:** The body of the lichen.
    *   **Structure (typically layered):**
        *   **Cortex:** Outer, tightly packed fungal layer.
        *   **Algal layer:** Below the upper cortex, where photobiont cells are concentrated.
        *   **Medulla:** Inner, loosely packed fungal layer.
        *   **Lower cortex (sometimes):** Similar to upper cortex.
        *   **Rhizines:** Hyphal bundles that attach the lichen to the substrate.
    *   **Types based on morphology:**
        *   **Crustose:** Crust-like, adhere tightly to substrate.
        *   **Foliose:** Leaf-like, with lobes.
        *   **Fruticose:** Shrub-like or hair-like, branched.
*   **Ecological Importance and Benefits:**
    *   **Pioneer Organisms:** Early colonizers in soilless environments (e.g., lava flows, bare rock).
    *   **Soil Production:** Contribute to soil formation by breaking down rock (via acids produced by the fungus).
    *   **Nitrogen Fixation:** Cyanobacteria in some lichens can fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the environment.
    *   **Soil Stabilizers:** Important in some desert environments.
    *   **Food Source:** Important winter food for animals like caribou.
    *   **Environmental Indicators:** Many lichens are very sensitive to air pollution (especially sulfur dioxide) and are used as bioindicators.
    *   **Source of Compounds:** Produce unique secondary metabolites (lichen acids) that have antibacterial, antiviral, or other bioactive properties. Used historically for dyes and traditional medicines.
*   **Microbiological Perspective:**
    *   Interesting for studying close relationships between unrelated microorganisms.
    *   Not known to cause infections in humans.

# Summary: 5.1 Unicellular Eukaryotic Parasites

This section introduces unicellular eukaryotic parasites, primarily protozoans, discussing their general characteristics, life cycles, modes of reproduction, classification challenges, and provides examples of infections they cause.

## Key Concepts:

*   **General Characteristics of Protozoans:**
    *   Unicellular eukaryotic organisms.
    *   Lack a cell wall (most).
    *   Often motile.
    *   Heterotrophic (feed on other organisms or organic matter).
    *   Live in diverse habitats (aquatic, soil, within hosts).
    *   Many are parasitic, causing diseases in animals and humans.
*   **Life Cycles and Reproduction:**
    *   Can have complex life cycles, sometimes involving multiple hosts or stages.
    *   **Trophozoite:** Active, feeding stage.
    *   **Cyst:** Dormant, protective stage; allows survival in harsh conditions and transmission.
    *   **Reproduction:**
        *   **Asexual:** Binary fission, budding, or schizogony (multiple fission).
        *   **Sexual:** Conjugation (genetic exchange) or syngamy (fusion of gametes).
*   **Classification Challenges and Taxonomy:**
    *   Historically challenging due to diversity.
    *   Modern classification relies on genetics (rRNA sequences) and ultrastructure.
    *   Grouped into several supergroups within Eukarya (e.g., Excavata, Amoebozoa, Chromalveolata, Rhizaria, Opisthokonta).
*   **Examples of Infections Caused by Unicellular Eukaryotes (Protozoans):**
    *   **Amoebozoa:**
        *   *Entamoeba histolytica:* Causes amoebic dysentery.
        *   *Naegleria fowleri:* "Brain-eating amoeba," causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).
        *   *Acanthamoeba* spp.: Can cause keratitis (eye infection) and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE).
    *   **Excavata (includes Fornicata, Parabasalia, Euglenozoa):**
        *   *Giardia lamblia (Fornicata):* Causes giardiasis (diarrheal illness).
        *   *Trichomonas vaginalis (Parabasalia):* Causes trichomoniasis (STI).
        *   *Trypanosoma brucei (Euglenozoa - Kinetoplastids):* Causes African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), transmitted by tsetse flies.
        *   *Trypanosoma cruzi (Euglenozoa - Kinetoplastids):* Causes Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis), transmitted by kissing bugs.
        *   *Leishmania* spp. (Euglenozoa - Kinetoplastids): Cause leishmaniasis (cutaneous, visceral, or mucosal), transmitted by sand flies.
    *   **Chromalveolata (includes Apicomplexans, Ciliates):**
        *   **Apicomplexans:** Obligate intracellular parasites with an "apical complex" for host cell penetration.
            *   *Plasmodium* spp.: Cause malaria, transmitted by *Anopheles* mosquitoes. Complex life cycle involving liver and red blood cells.
            *   *Toxoplasma gondii:* Causes toxoplasmosis; acquired from cat feces or undercooked meat. Can be serious in immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women.
            *   *Cryptosporidium parvum:* Causes cryptosporidiosis (diarrheal illness).
        *   **Ciliates:** *Balantidium coli* is the only pathogenic ciliate, causes balantidiasis (rare dysentery).
*   **Clinical Focus: Part 1**
    *   **Scenario:** Sarah, a 7-year-old, has an itchy, red circular skin lesion with a raised edge. A Wood's lamp causes it to fluoresce.
    *   **Diagnosis:** Ringworm (a fungal infection, not a worm, despite the name).
    *   **Question Posed:** How might Sarah have contracted ringworm? (e.g., contact with infected person, animal, or fomite).
*   **Neglected Parasitic Infections (NPIs):**
    *   Mentioned as a concern in the US, including toxoplasmosis, Chagas disease, toxocariasis.

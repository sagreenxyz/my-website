# Summary: 3.4 Unique Characteristics of Eukaryotic Cells

This section describes the defining features of eukaryotic cells, including their complex internal organization with a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, their cytoskeleton, and processes like mitosis and meiosis. It contrasts these features with those of prokaryotic cells.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Defining Characteristics of Eukaryotic Cells:**
    *   **Nucleus:** Presence of a true nucleus surrounded by a complex nuclear membrane, containing multiple, rod-shaped chromosomes.
    *   **Membrane-Bound Organelles:** Cytoplasm contains various organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and peroxisomes.
    *   **Cytoskeleton:** An internal network of protein filaments (microfilaments, intermediate filaments, microtubules) providing structural support, maintaining cell shape, and facilitating intracellular transport.
    *   **Size:** Generally larger than prokaryotic cells.
    *   **Organisms:** Include protozoans, algae, fungi, plants, and animals.
*   **Key Eukaryotic Structures and Organelles:**
    *   **Nucleus:** Contains DNA; site of transcription.
        *   **Nuclear Envelope:** Double membrane surrounding the nucleus.
        *   **Nucleolus:** Site of ribosome synthesis.
    *   **Ribosomes:** 80S type (larger than prokaryotic 70S ribosomes), found free in cytoplasm or attached to ER.
    *   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):**
        *   **Rough ER (RER):** Studded with ribosomes; involved in protein synthesis and modification.
        *   **Smooth ER (SER):** Lacks ribosomes; involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification, calcium storage.
    *   **Golgi Apparatus:** Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for secretion or delivery to other organelles.
    *   **Mitochondria:** "Powerhouses" of the cell; site of cellular respiration and ATP production. Contain their own DNA and 70S ribosomes.
    *   **Chloroplasts (in plants and algae):** Site of photosynthesis. Contain their own DNA and 70S ribosomes.
    *   **Lysosomes:** Contain digestive enzymes to break down waste materials and cellular debris.
    *   **Peroxisomes:** Involved in metabolic processes including detoxification; produce and break down hydrogen peroxide.
    *   **Cytoskeleton:** Provides structural support, cell movement, and intracellular transport.
        *   **Microfilaments (Actin filaments)**
        *   **Intermediate Filaments**
        *   **Microtubules**
    *   **Centrosomes (in animal cells):** Microtubule-organizing centers involved in cell division.
*   **External Structures (some eukaryotes):**
    *   **Cell Wall (in fungi, algae, plants):** Provides structural support and protection. Composition varies (e.g., chitin in fungi, cellulose in plants).
    *   **Flagella and Cilia:** For motility or moving substances across cell surface; more complex structure (9+2 microtubule arrangement) than prokaryotic flagella.
    *   **Glycocalyx (in some animal cells and protozoa):** Outer layer for protection, adhesion, cell recognition.
*   **Cell Division:**
    *   **Mitosis:** Asexual reproduction resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells. Used for growth and repair in multicellular organisms, and reproduction in some unicellular eukaryotes.
    *   **Meiosis:** Sexual reproduction process resulting in four genetically distinct haploid gametes.
    *   **Comparison to Prokaryotic Binary Fission:** Eukaryotic cell division is more complex due to the nucleus and multiple chromosomes.
*   **Endosymbiotic Theory Reminder:** Mitochondria and chloroplasts are thought to have originated from endosymbiotic bacteria, supported by their own DNA, 70S ribosomes, and double membranes.

# Summary: 3.3 Unique Characteristics of Prokaryotic Cells

This section details the defining features of prokaryotic cells, including their common morphologies, cellular arrangements, and the structure and function of their internal and external components. It also highlights key differences between bacterial and archaeal cells.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Fundamental Cell Components (All Cells):**
    *   **Cytoplasm:** Gel-like substance with water and dissolved chemicals.
    *   **Plasma Membrane (Cell Membrane):** Encloses cytoplasm.
    *   **Chromosomes:** Contain genetic blueprints (typically single, circular in prokaryotes).
    *   **Ribosomes:** Organelles for protein production.
*   **Defining Characteristics of Prokaryotic Cells:**
    *   **Lack of Nucleus:** No membrane-bound nucleus; genetic material (chromosome) located in a region called the **nucleoid**.
    *   **Chromosome:** Generally a single, circular chromosome.
    *   **Lack of Membrane-Bound Organelles:** Generally do not have complex membrane-bound organelles found in eukaryotes. May have **inclusions** for storage or compartmentalization.
    *   **Size:** Typically smaller than eukaryotic cells.
    *   **Classification:** Belong to domains Archaea and Bacteria.
*   **Common Cell Morphologies (Shapes):**
    *   Coccus (spherical), Bacillus (rod-shaped), Vibrio (curved rod), Coccobacillus (short rod), Spirillum (spiral), Spirochete (long, loose, helical spiral).
*   **Cellular Arrangements:**
    *   Determined by pattern of cell division. Examples: diplococcus (pairs), streptococcus (chains), staphylococcus (clusters), tetrads, sarcinae.
*   **External Structures:**
    *   **Cell Wall:** Provides structural support and shape. Composition differs between Bacteria (peptidoglycan) and Archaea.
    *   **Glycocalyx (Capsules and Slime Layers):** Outer layer for protection, adhesion, biofilm formation.
    *   **Flagella:** For motility.
    *   **Pili/Fimbriae:** For attachment (fimbriae) or DNA transfer (pili).
*   **Internal Structures:**
    *   **Plasma Membrane:** Regulates transport, site of some metabolic processes.
    *   **Cytoplasm:** Contains cytosol, ribosomes, nucleoid, inclusions.
    *   **Ribosomes (70S in prokaryotes):** Protein synthesis.
    *   **Inclusions:** Storage granules (e.g., for glycogen, phosphate, sulfur).
    *   **Endospores (in some bacteria):** Dormant, resistant structures for survival in harsh conditions.
*   **Comparison of Bacterial and Archaeal Cells:**
    *   **Cell Wall:** Bacteria have peptidoglycan; Archaea have pseudopeptidoglycan or other polymers (no peptidoglycan).
    *   **Plasma Membrane Lipids:** Bacteria have ester-linked fatty acids; Archaea have ether-linked isoprenoids.
    *   **Ribosomes:** Both 70S, but with some differences in protein and rRNA components.
    *   **Genetics & Metabolism:** Archaea share some traits with Eukarya (e.g., histone-like proteins, some metabolic pathways like methanogenesis unique to Archaea).

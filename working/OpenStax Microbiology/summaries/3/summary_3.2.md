# Summary: 3.2 Foundations of Modern Cell Theory

This section outlines the development of modern cell theory, crediting key scientists for their contributions. It also introduces the endosymbiotic theory as an explanation for the origin of certain eukaryotic organelles and touches upon the development of germ theory.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Modern Cell Theory - Basic Tenets:**
    1.  All cells only come from other cells (the principle of biogenesis).
    2.  Cells are the fundamental units of organisms.
*   **Historical Contributions to Cell Theory:**
    *   **Robert Hooke (1665):** First used the term "cells" to describe chambers in cork.
    *   **Matthias Schleiden (1838 - implied by learning objectives):** Proposed that all plants are made of cells.
    *   **Theodor Schwann (1839 - implied):** Proposed that all animals are made of cells. Together with Schleiden, laid the groundwork for cell theory.
    *   **Robert Remak (1850s - implied):** Published evidence that cells derive from other cells.
    *   **Rudolf Virchow (1850s - implied):** Popularized the concept "omnis cellula a cellula" (all cells arise from cells), though likely building on Remak's work.
*   **Endosymbiotic Theory:**
    *   **Concept:** Explains the origin of eukaryotic organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts as descendants of prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by an ancestral eukaryotic cell and established a symbiotic relationship.
    *   **Evidence (implied by learning objectives):**
        *   Mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA (circular, like prokaryotes).
        *   They possess their own ribosomes (similar to prokaryotic ribosomes).
        *   They replicate independently of the cell, similar to binary fission.
        *   They have double membranes, consistent with an engulfment event.
    *   **Key Proponents (implied):** Lynn Margulis significantly contributed to the modern formulation of this theory.
*   **Development of Germ Theory (Contributions of - implied by learning objectives):**
    *   **Ignaz Semmelweis:** Advocated for handwashing to prevent puerperal fever, suggesting unseen particles caused disease.
    *   **John Snow:** Traced cholera outbreaks to contaminated water, linking a specific microbe/source to disease.
    *   **Louis Pasteur:** His work on fermentation, pasteurization, and vaccines supported the idea that microbes cause disease and spoilage. Disproved spontaneous generation.
    *   **Joseph Lister:** Applied germ theory to surgery by using antiseptics (carbolic acid) to prevent infections.
    *   **Robert Koch:** Developed postulates to definitively link a specific microorganism to a specific disease.

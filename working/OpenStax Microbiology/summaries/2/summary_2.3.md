# Summary: 2.3 Instruments of Microscopy

This section details various types of microscopes used in modern science, focusing on their components, principles of operation, and applications, particularly for light microscopy, electron microscopy, and scanning probe microscopy.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Advancements in Microscopy:**
    *   **Joseph Jackson Lister (1830):** Created an essentially modern light microscope.
    *   **20th Century Developments:** Included fluorescence microscopy (UV light) and electron microscopy (electron beams), leading to improved magnification, resolution, and contrast.
*   **Light Microscopy:** Uses light to visualize images.
    *   **Brightfield Microscope:**
        *   Most commonly used type; a compound microscope producing a dark image on a bright background.
        *   **Components:** Eyepiece (ocular lens, typically 10x), objective lenses (on a rotating nosepiece, e.g., 4x to 100x), body tube, stage, illuminator, condenser, diaphragm, focus knobs.
        *   **Total Magnification:** Ocular magnification × objective magnification. (e.g., 10x ocular × 40x objective = 400x total magnification).
    *   **Other Light Microscopes (briefly mentioned as examples):**
        *   Darkfield microscope
        *   Phase-contrast microscope
        *   Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope
        *   Fluorescence microscope
        *   Confocal scanning laser microscope
        *   Two-photon microscope
*   **Electron Microscopy (EM):**
    *   Uses short-wavelength electron beams instead of light for much higher magnification and resolution.
    *   Allows visualization of viruses and internal cellular structures.
    *   Types mentioned in introduction: Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).
*   **Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM):**
    *   Uses a sharp probe that scans the surface of a specimen.
    *   Can visualize at atomic or molecular level.
*   **Footnote Example:**
    *   JEOL JEM-ARM200F Transmission Electron Microscope specifications cited for context on modern EM capabilities.

# Summary: 2.2 Peering Into the Invisible World

This section traces the historical development of the microscope, highlighting key individuals and their contributions that led to the ability to observe microorganisms. It also differentiates between simple and compound microscopes.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Early Postulates of Invisible Disease Agents:**
    *   **Girolamo Fracastoro (1546):** Proposed that disease was spread by tiny invisible "seminaria" (seeds of contagion) that could attach to objects (*fomes*) and transfer between people. This was hypothetical due to the lack of technology to see them.
*   **Invention and Development of Early Microscopes:**
    *   **Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (late 17th century):**
        *   Often called "the Father of Microbiology."
        *   Created powerful single-lens (simple) microscopes.
        *   First to observe and describe single-celled organisms ("animalcules" or microbes) in 1674.
    *   **Zaccharias Janssen (and his father Hans, late 1500s/early 1600s):**
        *   May have invented the telescope, simple microscope, and compound microscope, though historical evidence is inconclusive.
    *   **Robert Hooke (1665):**
        *   Coined the term "cells" after observing cork structures with his compound microscope.
*   **Types of Microscopes (Early Context):**
    *   **Simple Microscope:** Has a single lens (e.g., Leeuwenhoek's microscopes).
    *   **Compound Microscope:** Has multiple lenses to magnify the image (e.g., Hooke's, Janssen's).

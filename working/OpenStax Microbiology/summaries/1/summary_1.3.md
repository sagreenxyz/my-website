# Summary: 1.3 Types of Microorganisms

This section introduces the general characteristics of microorganisms, focusing on their size and the necessity of magnification for observation, and outlines the scope of microbial diversity.

## General Characteristics & Scope:

*   **Defining Microorganisms:**
    *   The section aims to list various types of microorganisms and describe their defining characteristics (as per learning objectives).
    *   It will provide examples of different types of cellular and viral microorganisms and infectious agents.
    *   A comparison of archaea and bacteria is intended.
    *   An overview of the field of microbiology is provided.
*   **Size and Visibility:**
    *   **Microscopic Nature:** Most microbes are unicellular and require artificial magnification to be seen.
    *   **Exceptions:** Some unicellular microbes are visible to the naked eye, and some multicellular organisms are microscopic.
    *   **Visibility Threshold:** An object must measure about 100 micrometers (µm) to be visible without a microscope.
    *   **Relative Sizes:**
        *   Typical animal cell: ~10 µm (microscopic).
        *   Bacterial cells: Typically ~1 µm.
        *   Viruses: Can be 10 times smaller than bacteria.
    *   **Units of Length:** Refers to [Table 1.1](#fs-id1171359070853) for units used in microbiology.
*   **Footnotes (Examples of Microbial Impact/Study):**
    *   Dracunculiasis (Guinea Worm Disease).
    *   Guatemala Syphilis Experiment.
    *   Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and its transmission (iatrogenic, corneal transplant).

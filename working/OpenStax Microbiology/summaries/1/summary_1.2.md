# Summary: 1.2 A Systematic Approach

This section discusses the importance and methods of classifying and naming microorganisms, highlighting the historical development of taxonomy.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Microbial Diversity:**
    *   The invention of microscopes revealed an enormous diversity among microorganisms in terms of size, appearance, and reproduction rates.
    *   This diversity necessitated a systematic way to organize and study them.
*   **Taxonomy:**
    *   **Definition:** The science of classification, description, identification, and naming of living organisms.
    *   **Classification:** The practice of organizing organisms into different groups based on shared characteristics.
*   **Historical Taxonomy: Carolus Linnaeus:**
    *   A Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician (1701–1778).
    *   Published *Systema Naturae* (1735), proposing Linnaean taxonomy.
    *   **Linnaean Taxonomy:** A hierarchical system for categorizing and naming organisms using a standard format, enabling consistent scientific communication.
*   **Modern Exploration:**
    *   Encourages learning about phylogenetic trees through resources like the Wellcome Trust’s interactive Tree of Life, which shows evolutionary relationships between organisms.

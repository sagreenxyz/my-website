# Summary: 6.3 Isolation, Culture, and Identification of Viruses

This section covers the methods used to isolate, cultivate, and identify viruses, emphasizing that viruses require living host cells for replication. It compares in vivo and in vitro cultivation techniques and discusses methods for detecting viral presence.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Historical Context:** Viruses originally described as "filterable agents" because they passed through porcelain Chamberland filters that retained bacteria (e.g., discovery of TMV).
*   **Isolation of Viruses:**
    *   Viruses require living host cells for replication (unlike bacteria, many of which grow on artificial media).
    *   Infected host cells (eukaryotic or prokaryotic) are cultured.
    *   Virions are harvested from the growth medium.
    *   Separation from host cells:
        *   **Centrifugation:** Pellets host cells, leaving virions in supernatant.
        *   **Filtration:** Membrane filters with pores small enough to retain host cells but allow virions to pass into the filtrate.
*   **Cultivation of Viruses:**
    *   **In Vivo Cultivation (within a whole living organism):**
        *   **Animals:** Used for viruses that don't grow in cell culture or for studying pathogenesis.
        *   **Embryonated Eggs:** Fertile chicken, turkey, or duck eggs are used. Different viruses replicate in specific parts of the egg (yolk sac, amniotic cavity, chorioallantoic membrane). Used for vaccine production (e.g., influenza).
    *   **In Vitro Cultivation (outside a living organism, in an artificial environment):**
        *   **Cell Culture (Tissue Culture):**
            *   Cells grown in vitro in culture medium.
            *   **Primary Cell Culture:** Derived directly from tissues; limited lifespan.
            *   **Continuous Cell Lines:** Transformed (often cancerous) cells that can be subcultured indefinitely (e.g., HeLa cells).
            *   Viruses are inoculated into cell cultures to replicate.
*   **Detection and Identification of Viruses:**
    *   **Cytopathic Effects (CPEs):** Observable changes in host cells due to viral infection (e.g., cell lysis, rounding, syncytia formation, inclusion bodies).
    *   **Hemagglutination Assay (HA):**
        *   Some viruses can agglutinate (clump) red blood cells (RBCs) by binding to surface receptors.
        *   Used to detect presence of certain viruses (e.g., influenza) and quantify them (titer).
    *   **Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay (HIA):**
        *   Uses antibodies to block viral hemagglutination.
        *   Can identify specific viruses or detect virus-specific antibodies in patient serum.
    *   **Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs):**
        *   Detect viral nucleic acids (DNA or RNA).
        *   Examples: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for DNA viruses, Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) for RNA viruses.
    *   **Enzyme Immunoassays (EIAs):**
        *   Use antibodies to detect viral antigens or antiviral antibodies.
        *   Example: ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay).
    *   **Plaque Assay (for bacteriophages and some animal viruses):**
        *   Viruses mixed with host cells are plated on agar.
        *   Viral lysis of host cells creates clear zones (**plaques**) in the cell lawn.
        *   Each plaque represents a single infectious virus particle (plaque-forming unit, PFU). Used for quantification.
*   **Specimen Collection and Handling:**
    *   Proper collection, storage, and transport are crucial for accurate viral diagnostics.

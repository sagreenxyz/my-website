# Summary: 6.2 The Viral Life Cycle

This section details the reproductive cycles of viruses, focusing on bacteriophages (lytic and lysogenic cycles) and animal viruses (replication process, unique characteristics of retroviruses and latent viruses). It also touches upon plant virus replication and transduction.

## Key Concepts:

*   **General Viral Dependence:** Viruses depend on host cells for reproduction and metabolism, commandeering cellular machinery.
*   **Bacteriophage Life Cycles:**
    *   Replicate only in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic host cells.
    *   **Virulent Phages (e.g., T-even phage):** Undergo the **lytic cycle**.
        1.  **Attachment:** Phage binds to specific bacterial surface receptors.
        2.  **Penetration (Entry):** Viral genome injected into host cell (phage head remains outside).
        3.  **Biosynthesis:** Phage DNA replicates, phage proteins synthesized using host machinery.
        4.  **Maturation (Assembly):** New phage particles assembled.
        5.  **Lysis (Release):** Host cell breaks open, releasing new virions.
    *   **Temperate Phages (e.g., lambda phage):** Can undergo either the lytic cycle or the **lysogenic cycle**.
        1.  **Lysogenic Cycle:**
            *   Phage DNA integrates into the host chromosome, becoming a **prophage**.
            *   The infected bacterium is called a **lysogen**.
            *   Prophage is replicated along with the host genome (lysogenic conversion can alter host phenotype).
            *   **Induction:** Prophage can excise from host chromosome and enter the lytic cycle (e.g., due to stress).
    *   **Transduction:** Transfer of bacterial DNA from one bacterium to another by a phage.
        *   **Generalized Transduction:** Random piece of bacterial DNA packaged into a phage during lytic cycle.
        *   **Specialized Transduction:** Specific bacterial genes near prophage integration site are transferred during imprecise excision from lysogenic cycle.
*   **Animal Virus Life Cycles:**
    *   **Replication Site:** Most DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus (exception: poxviruses in cytoplasm). Most RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm (exception: influenza virus).
    *   **Steps:**
        1.  **Attachment:** Virus binds to specific host cell receptors.
        2.  **Penetration:**
            *   **Endocytosis:** Virus engulfed by host cell membrane.
            *   **Membrane Fusion:** Enveloped viruses fuse their envelope with host cell membrane.
        3.  **Uncoating:** Viral capsid removed, releasing genome.
        4.  **Biosynthesis:** Replication of viral genome and synthesis of viral proteins (strategy varies based on DNA/RNA, ss/ds, +/- sense RNA).
        5.  **Assembly (Maturation):** New viral particles assembled.
        6.  **Release:**
            *   **Lysis:** Nonenveloped viruses often lyse the host cell.
            *   **Budding:** Enveloped viruses acquire envelope by budding through host cell membrane (plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, ER). Does not necessarily kill cell immediately.
*   **Unique Characteristics of Specific Animal Viruses:**
    *   **Retroviruses (e.g., HIV):**
        *   +ssRNA viruses with enzyme **reverse transcriptase**.
        *   Reverse transcriptase converts ssRNA genome into dsDNA (**provirus**).
        *   Provirus integrates into host chromosome (permanent infection).
    *   **Latent Viruses (e.g., herpesviruses, varicella-zoster virus):**
        *   Can remain dormant in host cells for long periods without causing symptoms (latency).
        *   Can reactivate to cause recurrent infections.
*   **Plant Virus Replication:**
    *   Similar to animal viruses but with differences in entry (often require mechanical damage or insect vectors).
    *   Can cause significant crop damage.
*   **Host Cell Interactions:**
    *   Viruses can cause acute infections, chronic infections, or latent infections.
    *   Some viruses are oncogenic (can cause cancer).

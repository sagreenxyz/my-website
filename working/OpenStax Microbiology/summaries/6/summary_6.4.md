# Summary: 6.4 Viroids, Virusoids, and Prions

This section describes acellular, nonliving infectious agents that are distinct from viruses: viroids (RNA particles), virusoids (RNA particles requiring a helper virus), and prions (proteinaceous infectious particles).

## Key Concepts:

*   **Discovery Context:** Research into unknown disease agents led to the discovery of these nonliving entities capable of self-propagation at the expense of a host.
*   **Viroids:**
    *   **Discovery:** Theodor Diener (1971), named them "virus-like."
    *   **Composition:** Consist only of a short strand of circular, single-stranded RNA.
    *   **No Protein Coat (Capsid):** Unlike viruses, their genetic information is not protected by a protein coat.
    *   **Self-Replication:** Capable of self-replication within a host cell, taking control of host machinery.
    *   **Pathogenicity:** Primarily known to cause diseases in plants.
    *   **Example:** Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV) causes slower sprouting and deformities in potato plants.
    *   **Mechanism:** Some viroids are ribozymes (RNA enzymes) that can cleave RNA.
*   **Virusoids:**
    *   **Composition:** Subviral particles consisting of non-self-replicating single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs).
    *   **Dependence:** Require a "helper" virus for replication. The host cell must be co-infected with the specific helper virus.
    *   **Genome:** Do not code for proteins; their RNA is replicated by the helper virus's machinery.
    *   **Pathogenicity:** Considered plant pathogens.
    *   **Example:** Subterranean clover mottle virus (helper virus) has an associated virusoid.
*   **Prions (Proteinaceous Infectious Particles):**
    *   **Discovery:** Stanley Prusiner (late 20th century) proposed the concept.
    *   **Composition:** Misfolded rogue form (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) of a normal host protein called PrP<sup>C</sup> (prion protein, cellular).
    *   **No Nucleic Acid:** Contain no DNA or RNA.
    *   **Mechanism of Propagation:** PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can induce normal PrP<sup>C</sup> proteins to misfold into the rogue PrP<sup>Sc</sup> form, leading to a chain reaction and accumulation of abnormal protein.
    *   **Pathogenicity:** Cause **transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)**, which are fatal neurodegenerative diseases.
        *   Characterized by sponge-like lesions in the brain, dementia, loss of coordination.
    *   **Examples of TSEs:**
        *   **In Animals:**
            *   Scrapie (sheep and goats)
            *   Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow disease")
            *   Chronic wasting disease (CWD) (deer and elk)
        *   **In Humans:**
            *   Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) - can be sporadic, familial, or iatrogenic (acquired).
            *   Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) - linked to BSE exposure.
            *   Kuru - formerly seen in Papua New Guinea, associated with ritualistic cannibalism.
            *   Gerstmann-Str√§ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) - hereditary.
            *   Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) - hereditary.
    *   **Transmission:** Can be transmitted through ingestion of contaminated meat/nervous tissue, heredity, or contaminated medical instruments.
    *   **Resistance:** Prions are extremely resistant to heat, chemicals, and radiation. Standard sterilization procedures may not inactivate them.

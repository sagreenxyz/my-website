# Summary: 6.1 Viruses

This section introduces viruses, detailing their general characteristics as acellular, obligate intracellular parasites. It covers their discovery, structure (genome and capsid), classification, and the general features of viral life cycles, differentiating among bacteriophages, plant viruses, and animal viruses.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Discovery of Viruses:**
    *   **Dmitri Ivanovski (1892):** Discovered a filterable agent smaller than bacteria causing tobacco mosaic disease (TMD), using porcelain Chamberland filters (pore size 0.1 Âµm). Credited as a founder of virology.
    *   **Martinus Beijerinck (1899):** Concluded the TMD agent was not a bacterium but possibly a chemical toxin; coined the term "virus" (Latin for poison).
*   **General Characteristics of Viruses:**
    *   **Acellular:** Not cells; lack cellular structures like organelles, ribosomes, plasma membrane.
    *   **Obligate Intracellular Parasites:** Must infect a cellular host to survive and reproduce.
    *   **Host Specificity:** Infect specific host cells (bacteria, archaea, fungi, protists, plants, animals).
    *   **Genome:** Possess either DNA or RNA (never both), which can be single-stranded or double-stranded, linear or circular.
    *   **Capsid:** Protein coat surrounding the genome, composed of protein subunits called capsomeres.
    *   **Envelope (some viruses):** Lipid membrane derived from the host cell membrane, studded with viral glycoproteins (spikes). Viruses without an envelope are "naked" or "nonenveloped."
    *   **Virion:** Complete, infectious virus particle.
    *   **Size:** Very small, typically measured in nanometers (nm); require electron microscopes to be seen.
    *   **Metabolically Inactive:** Lack genes for many products needed for reproduction; exploit host cell machinery.
*   **Viral Genomes:**
    *   Can be DNA or RNA.
    *   Can be single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds).
    *   Smaller than cellular genomes.
*   **Classification of Viruses:**
    *   Based on: genomics (DNA/RNA, ss/ds), capsid structure, envelope presence, host range, Baltimore classification system (based on mRNA synthesis pathway).
    *   Not included in the traditional tree of life because they are acellular.
*   **Viral Life Cycles (General Overview):**
    *   Virus genome enters host cell and directs production of viral components.ypion
    *   New virions are assembled in the host cell.
    *   New virions are released to infect other host cells.
*   **Types of Viruses (Based on Host):**
    *   **Bacteriophages (Phages):** Viruses that infect bacteria.
    *   **Plant Viruses:** Viruses that infect plants.
    *   **Animal Viruses:** Viruses that infect animals.
*   **Clinical Focus: Part 1**
    *   **Scenario:** David, a journalist returning from travel, experiences weakness, fever, headache, agitation, and discomfort, possibly related to a dog bite. Wound culture is negative for pathogenic bacteria.
    *   **Questions Posed:** What additional tests should be performed? What treatment should be recommended? (Suggests a possible viral infection like rabies).
*   **Table 6.1 Summary:**
    *   Infectious, acellular pathogens.
    *   Obligate intracellular parasites with host/cell-type specificity.
    *   DNA or RNA genome.
    *   Genome surrounded by protein capsid (and sometimes an envelope).
    *   Lack genes for many products, exploit host cell genomes.

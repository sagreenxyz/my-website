# Summary: 4.6 Archaea

This section describes the domain Archaea, highlighting their unique cellular characteristics that distinguish them from Bacteria, their diversity, presence in extreme environments, and their classification into major phyla. It also notes their general lack of association with human pathology.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Domain Archaea:**
    *   Unicellular prokaryotic organisms.
    *   Structurally different from Bacteria.
*   **Unique Characteristics of Archaea (Compared to Bacteria):**
    *   **Cell Membrane:** Composed of ether linkages with branched isoprene chains (Bacteria have ester linkages with unbranched fatty acids). Some have lipid monolayers.
    *   **Cell Walls:** Lack peptidoglycan. Some contain pseudopeptidoglycan (pseudomurein) or other polymers (e.g., S-layers).
    *   **Genomes:** Larger and more complex than bacterial genomes. Share some features with eukaryotes (e.g., histones, similar RNA polymerase).
    *   **Metabolism:** Can perform methanogenesis (unique to Archaea).
*   **Habitats and Lifestyles:**
    *   Found in nearly every habitat, including extreme environments (**extremophiles**).
        *   Hyperthermophiles (extreme heat).
        *   Psychrophiles (extreme cold).
        *   Halophiles (extreme salinity).
        *   Acidophiles (extreme acidity).
        *   Alkaliphiles (extreme alkalinity).
    *   Some are **mesophiles** (moderate environments).
*   **Human Microbiome and Pathology:**
    *   Generally not present in significant numbers in the human microbiota.
    *   None are currently known to be definitive human pathogens, though some are found in sites like the oral cavity and gut, and their role in disease is still being explored (e.g., *Methanobrevibacter oralis* in gum disease).
*   **Major Phyla of Archaea:**
    *   **Crenarchaeota:**
        *   Extremely diverse, mostly aquatic.
        *   Many are hyperthermophiles and/or acidophiles.
        *   Examples:
            *   *Sulfolobus* spp.: Thermophiles and acidophiles (grow at ~70-80°C, pH 2-3). Used in biotechnology for thermostable proteins (affitins).
            *   *Pyrolobus fumarii:* Hyperthermophile, can grow at 113°C.
    *   **Euryarchaeota:**
        *   Diverse, includes methanogens and halophiles.
        *   **Methanogens:** Produce methane (CH4) as a metabolic byproduct. Strictly anaerobic. Found in anoxic environments (e.g., swamps, animal guts). Examples: *Methanobacterium*, *Methanococcus*.
        *   **Halophiles:** Require high salt concentrations (halobacteria). Examples: *Halobacterium salinarum* (uses bacteriorhodopsin for a type of photosynthesis), *Halococcus*.
    *   **Korarchaeota (mentioned as a major phylum):** Rare, found in hydrothermal environments.
    *   **Nanoarchaeota (mentioned as a major phylum):** *Nanoarchaeum equitans* is an obligate symbiont of another archaeon.
    *   **Thaumarchaeota (mentioned as a major phylum):** Includes ammonia-oxidizing archaea important in nitrogen cycling.
*   **Ecological Roles:**
    *   Important in various biogeochemical cycles (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, sulfur).
    *   Methanogens play a role in decomposition and are used in biogas production.

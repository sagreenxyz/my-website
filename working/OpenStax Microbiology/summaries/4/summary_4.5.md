# Summary: 4.5 Deeply Branching Bacteria

This section introduces the concept of deeply branching bacteria, which are considered to represent early evolutionary forms of life, stemming close to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) on the phylogenetic tree.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Phylogenetic Tree Context:**
    *   The root/trunk of the phylogenetic tree represents the **last universal common ancestor (LUCA)**.
    *   Branches represent evolutionary descendants.
*   **Deeply Branching Bacteria:**
    *   Considered to be among the earliest forms of life to evolve from LUCA, around 3.5 billion years ago.
    *   Their position on the phylogenetic tree is close to the LUCA root, hence "deeply branching."
    *   Many are **extremophiles**, adapted to harsh conditions similar to those thought to exist on early Earth (e.g., high temperatures, intense UV radiation).
*   **Examples of Deeply Branching Bacteria:**
    *   **Class Aquificae:**
        *   Gram-negative, hyperthermophilic (live in hot springs, oceanic vents).
        *   Example: *Aquifex pyrophilus* thrives at 85-95 °C.
    *   **Class Thermotogae:**
        *   Gram-negative, hyperthermophilic anaerobes.
        *   Cell wall resembles a "toga" (outer membrane sheath).
        *   Example: *Thermotoga maritima* lives near thermal ocean vents, grows at 90 °C.
    *   **Phylum Deinococcus-Thermus:**
        *   Polyextremophiles (resistant to multiple extreme conditions).
        *   **Deinococcus radiodurans:**
            *   "Conan the Bacterium."
            *   Highly resistant to ionizing radiation due to efficient DNA repair mechanisms.
            *   Also resistant to desiccation, UV light, and some chemicals.
            *   Forms tetrads.
        *   ***Thermus aquaticus*:**
            *   Thermophile, grows at 70 °C.
            *   Source of **Taq polymerase**, a heat-stable DNA polymerase crucial for PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction).
*   **Significance:**
    *   Provide insights into early life forms and conditions on ancient Earth.
    *   Source of unique enzymes (like Taq polymerase) with important biotechnological applications.
*   **Footnote Example:**
    *   *Acetothermus paucivorans* cited as an example of a deeply branching bacterium (though the text focuses on Aquificae, Thermotogae, and Deinococcus-Thermus).

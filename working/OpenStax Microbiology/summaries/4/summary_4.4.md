# Summary: 4.4 Gram-Positive Bacteria

This section focuses on gram-positive bacteria, characterized by their thick peptidoglycan cell wall that retains the crystal violet stain in the Gram staining procedure. They are broadly classified into two groups based on their G+C content: high G+C (Actinobacteria) and low G+C (Bacilli).

## Key Concepts:

*   **Gram-Positive Bacteria:**
    *   Possess a multiple-layer matrix of peptidoglycan in their cell wall.
    *   Retain crystal violet stain, appearing purple after Gram staining.
    *   Classified based on G+C content in DNA and 16S rRNA composition.
*   **Actinobacteria: High G+C Gram-Positive Bacteria (>50% G+C):**
    *   Diverse morphology (filamentous branching rods to coccobacilli).
    *   Mostly soil-dwelling, some aquatic; vast majority are aerobic.
    *   Presence of several different peptidoglycans in cell wall.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   ***Actinomyces*:** Soil ecology, some human pathogens (e.g., *A. israelii* causes periodontitis, endocarditis).
        *   ***Mycobacterium*:** Acid-fast due to mycolic acid in cell wall.
            *   *M. tuberculosis:* Causes tuberculosis.
            *   *M. leprae:* Causes leprosy.
        *   ***Corynebacterium*:** Often form palisades (pairs of rod-shaped cells). Contain diaminopimelic acid in cell walls.
            *   *C. diphtheriae:* Causes diphtheria.
        *   ***Bifidobacterium*:** Anaerobic, common in human GI tract, vagina; used as probiotics.
        *   ***Gardnerella*:** *G. vaginalis* causes bacterial vaginosis; gram-variable (stains inconsistently).
        *   ***Streptomyces*:** Soil-dwelling, source of many antibiotics.
*   **Bacilli: Low G+C Gram-Positive Bacteria (<50% G+C):**
    *   **Clostridia (Class):** Mostly obligate anaerobes. Produce endospores. Produce potent protein toxins.
        *   ***Clostridium*:**
            *   *C. perfringens:* Causes gas gangrene, food poisoning.
            *   *C. tetani:* Causes tetanus.
            *   *C. botulinum:* Causes botulism.
            *   *C. difficile:* Causes pseudomembranous colitis.
    *   **Lactobacillales (Order):** Includes Bacilli and Cocci.
        *   ***Lactobacillus*:** Microaerophilic; ferment sugars into lactic acid; part of normal microbiota (gut, vagina); used in food production (yogurt, cheese).
        *   ***Streptococcus*:**
            *   *S. pyogenes:* β-hemolytic; causes strep throat, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis.
            *   *S. pneumoniae:* α-hemolytic (some strains); causes pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis.
            *   *S. mutans:* Part of oral microbiota, causes dental caries.
        *   ***Enterococcus*:** *E. faecium* and *E. faecalis* are commensal gut bacteria, can cause opportunistic infections (UTI, endocarditis), often antibiotic-resistant (e.g., VRE).
    *   **Bacilli (Class and Genus):** Aerobes or facultative anaerobes. Form endospores.
        *   ***Bacillus*:**
            *   *B. anthracis:* Causes anthrax.
            *   *B. cereus:* Causes food poisoning.
            *   *B. subtilis:* Important in industrial microbiology.
            *   *B. thuringiensis:* Produces insecticidal toxins.
    *   **Staphylococci (Genus):** Cocci, form grape-like clusters. Facultative anaerobes. Salt-tolerant.
        *   ***Staphylococcus*:**
            *   *S. aureus:* Can be pathogenic; causes skin infections, food poisoning, toxic shock syndrome. Often antibiotic-resistant (MRSA, VRSA).
            *   *S. epidermidis:* Common on skin; can cause opportunistic infections (e.g., in catheters, prostheses).
    *   **Mycoplasmas (Genus *Mycoplasma*):**
        *   Lack cell walls (do not stain gram-positive but are related to low G+C gram-positives).
        *   Very small, pleomorphic.
        *   Example: *M. pneumoniae* causes atypical pneumonia ("walking pneumonia").

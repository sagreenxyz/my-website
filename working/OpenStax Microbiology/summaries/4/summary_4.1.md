# Summary: 4.1 Prokaryote Habitats, Relationships, and Microbiomes

This section introduces the ubiquity and diversity of prokaryotes (Archaea and Bacteria), describing their presence in various habitats, their ecological roles, and their symbiotic relationships, including the human microbiome. It also touches upon how prokaryotes are classified.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Domains of Life:** All living organisms are classified into Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. This chapter focuses on Archaea and Bacteria, which are unicellular prokaryotic organisms lacking a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
*   **Prokaryote Habitats and Functions:**
    *   **Ubiquity:** Found everywhere, including extreme environments (hot springs, Antarctic ice, deep sea). Example: *Paracoccus denitrificans* surviving extreme gravitational forces.
    *   **Human Body:** Abundant on and within the human body (mouth, nasal cavity, gut, skin). Estimated ratio to human cells is significant (though revised from 10:1 to closer to 1:1).
    *   **Ecological Roles:**
        *   Essential for ecosystem stability (e.g., soil formation, decomposition, nutrient cycling).
        *   Example: Billions of microorganisms in soil contribute to fertility.
        *   Example: Halobacteria in salty lakes decompose organic matter.
*   **Symbiotic Relationships:**
    *   **Symbiosis:** Interaction between different species living in close physical association.
    *   **Mutualism:** Both populations benefit.
    *   **Amensalism:** One population is harmed, the other is unaffected.
    *   **Commensalism:** One population benefits, the other is unaffected.
    *   **Neutralism:** Neither population is affected.
    *   **Parasitism:** One population (parasite) benefits, the other (host) is harmed.
*   **Microbiomes:**
    *   **Definition:** All prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms associated with a certain organism or environment.
    *   **Human Microbiome:**
        *   **Resident Microbiota:** Microorganisms that constantly live in/on our bodies.
        *   **Transient Microbiota:** Microorganisms temporarily found in/on the body.
        *   Importance: Varies by body site; can be beneficial (e.g., digestion, immune development) or opportunistic pathogens.
        *   Examples: *Staphylococcus epidermidis* on skin, *Bacteroides* in gut.
        *   Human Microbiome Project (HMP): Aims to characterize the human microbiota.
*   **Classification of Prokaryotes:**
    *   Traditionally based on shape, staining patterns, biochemical/physiological differences.
    *   Modern classification relies heavily on nucleotide sequences in genes (e.g., 16S rRNA).
    *   *Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology* is a standard reference.
*   **Clinical Focus: Part 1**
    *   **Scenario:** Marsha, after returning from Nigeria, develops fatigue, cough, night sweats, loss of appetite, and low-grade fever, later coughing up blood-tinged sputum and experiencing chest pain.
    *   **Question Posed:** Could Marshaâ€™s symptoms be related to her overseas travel, even weeks later? (Suggests a possible infectious disease with an incubation period, like tuberculosis).

# Summary: 4.3 Nonproteobacteria Gram-Negative Bacteria and Phototrophic Bacteria

This section describes several groups of gram-negative bacteria that do not belong to the phylum Proteobacteria, including Chlamydia, Spirochetes, the CFB group, and Planctomycetes. It also covers a diverse group of phototrophic bacteria.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Nonproteobacteria Gram-Negative Bacteria:** Gram-negative bacteria not classified within Proteobacteria.
    *   **Chlamydia (Phylum Chlamydiae):**
        *   Obligate intracellular pathogens.
        *   Resistant to cellular defenses.
        *   Life cycle involves metabolically inactive **elementary bodies** (infectious form) and active **reticulate bodies** (replicative form).
        *   Example: *Chlamydia trachomatis* causes trachoma (eye disease, blindness) and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV, an STI).
    *   **Spirochetes (Phylum Spirochaetes):**
        *   Long, spiral-shaped, highly motile due to axial filament (endoflagellum).
        *   Difficult to culture.
        *   Examples:
            *   *Treponema pallidum:* Causes syphilis.
            *   *Borrelia burgdorferi:* Causes Lyme disease (transmitted by ticks).
    *   **CFB Group (Phyla Cytophaga, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides):**
        *   Share some rRNA sequence similarity.
        *   Rod-shaped, adapted to anaerobic environments (e.g., gums, gut, rumen).
        *   **Cytophaga:** Motile by gliding; aquatic; digest cellulose.
        *   **Fusobacterium:** Inhabit human mouth; can cause periodontal disease and other infections.
        *   **Bacteroides:** Predominant in human large intestine; mostly mutualistic (help digest food, prevent pathogen colonization), but some are opportunistic pathogens. *B. melaninogenicus* can cause wound infections.
    *   **Planctomycetes (Phylum Planctomycetes):**
        *   Aquatic bacteria, reproduce by budding.
        *   Some are motile, some sessile (with a holdfast).
        *   Some have internal membrane-bound compartments (e.g., anammoxosome in anammox bacteria).
*   **Phototrophic Bacteria:**
    *   Large, diverse group using sunlight as primary energy source via photosynthesis.
    *   Includes Proteobacteria and Nonproteobacteria.
    *   Contain bacteriochlorophylls (green, purple, or blue pigments).
    *   **Categories:**
        *   **Purple Sulfur Bacteria:** Anaerobic, oxidize hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid. (Gammaproteobacteria, e.g., *Chromatium*).
        *   **Green Sulfur Bacteria:** Anaerobic, oxidize sulfide. (e.g., *Chlorobium*).
        *   **Purple Nonsulfur Bacteria:** Use hydrogen rather than hydrogen sulfide for oxidation. (Alphaproteobacteria, e.g., *Rhodospirillum*).
        *   **Green Nonsulfur Bacteria:** Similar to green sulfur bacteria but use substrates other than sulfides for oxidation. (e.g., *Chloroflexus*).
        *   **Cyanobacteria (Blue-Green Algae):**
            *   Perform oxygenic photosynthesis (produce oxygen).
            *   Highly adaptable, diverse morphologies (unicellular, filamentous, colonial).
            *   Can fix nitrogen (in heterocysts).
            *   Some produce toxins (cyanotoxins) causing harmful algal blooms.
            *   Examples: *Microcystis aeruginosa* (toxin producer).
            *   Thought to have played a key role in Earth's oxygenation.
            *   Endosymbiotic theory suggests chloroplasts evolved from ancestral cyanobacteria.

# 1.5: Tissue Organization

## Overview
Cells organize into tissues, which are groups of similar cells performing a specific function. Understanding tissue structure is crucial for understanding organ function and disease.

## Primary Tissue Types
- **Epithelial Tissue:** Covers body surfaces, lines cavities and tubes, forms glands. Functions include protection, secretion, absorption, excretion, filtration, diffusion, and sensory reception.
- **Connective Tissue:** Supports, connects, or separates different types of tissues and organs. Includes bone, cartilage, fat, blood, and fibrous connective tissue. Characterized by cells scattered within an extracellular matrix.
- **Muscle Tissue:** Specialized for contraction, producing movement.
    - Skeletal Muscle (voluntary)
    - Smooth Muscle (involuntary)
    - Cardiac Muscle (involuntary, found in the heart)
- **Nervous Tissue:** Composed of neurons and glial cells, responsible for transmitting electrical impulses and coordinating body activities.

## Extracellular Matrix (ECM)
- A network of macromolecules (e.g., collagen, elastin, proteoglycans) secreted by cells.
- Provides structural and biochemical support to surrounding cells.
- Plays a role in cell adhesion, communication, and differentiation.

        ],
        "correct_answer": "a thick, myelinated axon",

        "explanation": "An action potential is generated at the axon hillock when the membrane potential reaches the threshold. Typically, the resting membrane potential of a neuron is around -70 mV, and the threshold is around -55 mV. Therefore, a depolarization of approximately +15 mV is needed for summation of postsynaptic potentials to trigger an action potential."

        "correct_answer": "hyperpolarizing",
        "explanation": "If a channel opens on a postsynaptic membrane and allows negative ions, such as chloride (Cl-), to enter the cell, it will cause the inside of the cell to become more negative, leading to hyperpolarization. This makes it less likely for the neuron to reach the threshold for an action potential."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "metabotropic receptor",
        "explanation": "Metabotropic receptors are transmembrane receptors that do not directly open ion channels. Instead, they activate intracellular signaling pathways involving effector proteins, such as G proteins, which then go on to open ion channels or trigger other cellular responses."

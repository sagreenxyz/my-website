        "options": [
          "Blood is about 92 percent water.",
          "Blood is slightly more acidic than water.",
          "Blood is slightly more viscous than water.",
          "Blood is slightly more salty than seawater."
        ],
        "correct_answer": "Blood is slightly more viscous than water.",
        "explanation": "Blood is approximately 55% plasma (which is about 92% water) and 45% formed elements. The presence of these formed elements, especially red blood cells and plasma proteins, makes blood slightly more viscous (thicker) than water. Blood is slightly alkaline (pH 7.35-7.45) and less salty than seawater."

        "options": [
          "increased heart rate",
          "increased sweating",
          "dilated pupils",
          "increased stomach motility"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "increased stomach motility",
        "explanation": "The sympathetic fight-or-flight response typically involves increased heart rate, increased sweating, and dilated pupils to prepare the body for action. Digestive activities, such as stomach motility, are usually decreased or inhibited during this response to conserve energy for more immediate needs."

        "question_text": "Which type of fiber could be considered the longest?",
        "options": [
          "preganglionic parasympathetic",
          "preganglionic sympathetic",
          "postganglionic parasympathetic",
          "postganglionic sympathetic"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "preganglionic parasympathetic",
        "explanation": "In the parasympathetic nervous system, preganglionic fibers originate in the brainstem or sacral spinal cord and extend to ganglia located near or within the target organs. This results in long preganglionic fibers and short postganglionic fibers. In contrast, the sympathetic system has short preganglionic fibers and long postganglionic fibers."

          "adrenal gland",
          "chain ganglion"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "intermural ganglion",
        "explanation": "Sympathetic preganglionic fibers originate in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord and typically synapse in either the sympathetic chain ganglia (paravertebral ganglia) or the collateral ganglia (prevertebral ganglia). Some preganglionic fibers also directly innervate the adrenal medulla. Intermural ganglia are usually associated with the parasympathetic nervous system, located near or within the walls of target organs."

          "vision",
          "taste",
          "baroreception",
          "proprioception"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "baroreception",
        "explanation": "While both the somatic and autonomic nervous systems receive sensory input, baroreception, the detection of blood pressure, is a type of sensory information that primarily drives autonomic reflexes to regulate cardiovascular function. Vision, taste, and proprioception have significant roles in the somatic sensory system leading to conscious perception and motor control, although they can also influence autonomic responses."

          "serotonin"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "acetylcholine",
        "explanation": "Pupil constriction (miosis) is primarily mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system. Acetylcholine (ACh) released by postganglionic parasympathetic fibers binds to muscarinic receptors on the pupillary constrictor muscle of the iris, causing it to contract and the pupil to constrict."

          "vagus nerve",
          "cardiac accelerator nerve"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "cardiac accelerator nerve",
        "explanation": "The term 'cardiac accelerator nerve' typically refers to the postganglionic sympathetic fibers that innervate the heart and cause an increase in heart rate and contractility. However, in a broader sense, the sympathetic pathway to the heart, including the preganglionic fibers originating from the thoracic spinal cord, contributes to this effect and might be referred to in this context."

          "isotope"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "atom",
        "explanation": "An atom is the smallest unit of an element that retains the chemical properties of that element. Electrons are subatomic particles, elemental particle is a broad term, and isotopes are variants of an element."

        "question_text": "On the periodic table of the elements, mercury (Hg) has an atomic number of 80 and a mass number of 200.59. It has seven stable isotopes. The most abundant of these probably have ________.",
        "options": [
          "about 80 neutrons each",

          "more electrons than neutrons"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "more than 80 neutrons each",
        "explanation": "The number of neutrons can be estimated by subtracting the atomic number (number of protons) from the mass number. In this case, approximately 200.59 - 80 = 120.59 neutrons. Therefore, the most abundant isotopes likely have more than 80 neutrons."

        "correct_answer": "H2",
        "explanation": "A molecule is formed when two or more atoms are chemically bonded together. A compound is a molecule made of atoms of different elements. H2 is a molecule consisting of two atoms of the same element (hydrogen), so it is a molecule but not a compound. H2O is a compound, 2H represents two separate atoms, and H+ is an ion."

          "polar covalent bonds",
          "hydrogen bonds"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "polar covalent bonds",
        "explanation": "Nitrogen and hydrogen have different electronegativities, meaning they do not share electrons equally. This unequal sharing results in polar covalent bonds, where the electrons are attracted more strongly to the nitrogen atom, creating partial charges on the atoms."

          "all of the above"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "an ion",
        "explanation": "An ion is an atom or molecule that has gained or lost one or more electrons, giving it a net electrical charge. When an atom donates an electron, it loses a negative charge and becomes a positively charged ion (cation). An anion is a negatively charged ion (gains electrons). Nonpolar refers to a molecule with equal sharing of electrons."

        "correct_answer": "salt",
        "explanation": "A salt is an ionic compound formed from the reaction between an acid and a base. It consists of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions held together by ionic bonds in a crystal lattice. Electrolytes are substances that conduct electricity when dissolved in water, and many salts are electrolytes. A dipole refers to a molecule with a separation of charge. Noble gases are unreactive elements."

          "Ionic bonds are stronger than Covalent bonds.",
          "Hydrogen bonds occur between two atoms of hydrogen.",
          "Bonding readily occurs between nonpolar and polar molecules.",
          "A molecule of water is unlikely to bond with an ion."
        ],
        "correct_answer": "Ionic bonds are stronger than Covalent bonds.",
        "explanation": "In general, ionic bonds are considered stronger than individual covalent bonds. Hydrogen bonds are weak attractions between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an electronegative atom (like O, N, or F) and another electronegative atom. Nonpolar molecules do not readily bond with polar molecules, and water (a polar molecule) readily interacts with ions through ion-dipole interactions."

          "exchange"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "synthesis",
        "explanation": "A synthesis reaction involves the formation of larger molecules from smaller atoms or molecules. The bonding of elements to form mineral crystals is a process of building up larger structures."

          "exchange"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "decomposition",
        "explanation": "The general notation AB → A + B represents a decomposition reaction, where a larger molecule (AB) is broken down into smaller components (A and B). Anabolic reactions build larger molecules, endergonic reactions absorb energy, and exchange reactions involve the swapping of components between molecules."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "Catabolic, exergonic, and decomposition",
        "explanation": "Catabolic reactions involve the breakdown of complex molecules, which typically releases energy. Exergonic reactions are defined as those that release energy. Decomposition reactions, where larger molecules are broken down into smaller ones, are often catabolic and exergonic."

          "saliva contains enzymes"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "saliva contains enzymes",
        "explanation": "Saliva contains enzymes, such as amylase, which are biological catalysts that speed up the chemical breakdown of carbohydrates (like starch in bread) into simpler sugars. Chewing increases the surface area of the food, allowing the enzymes to work more effectively."

        "correct_answer": "organic",
        "explanation": "Organic compounds are generally defined as those containing carbon and hydrogen bonded together. Methane (CH4) fits this description. Inorganic compounds typically do not contain carbon-hydrogen bonds. While methane can react under certain conditions, it's not considered highly reactive in normal biological contexts. It is also a gas, not a crystal, at room temperature."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "sodium ions and chloride ions",
        "explanation": "When sodium chloride (NaCl) dissolves in water, it dissociates into its constituent ions, sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-). These ions are surrounded by water molecules and become evenly distributed throughout the solution, forming a homogeneous mixture. NaCl molecules primarily exist as dissociated ions in water. Salt crystals are the solid form before dissolving. Red blood cells are large structures that form a suspension in blood, not a solution in water."

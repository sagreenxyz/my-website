        ],
        "correct_answer": "filtration, absorption, and secretion",
        "explanation": "Urine formation involves three main processes that modify the composition of blood plasma: glomerular filtration (movement of fluid and solutes from blood to nephron), tubular reabsorption (movement of substances from nephron back to blood), and tubular secretion (movement of substances from blood to nephron)."
      },

          "false"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "true",
        "explanation": "True. A minimum systemic blood pressure of around 60 mm Hg is necessary to maintain adequate glomerular filtration rate (GFR). If blood pressure drops significantly below this level, GFR decreases, and the kidneys may not be able to filter blood effectively."

          "false"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "false",
        "explanation": "False. Aquaporin channels, which facilitate the movement of water across cell membranes, are found in various parts of the nephron, including the proximal convoluted tubule and the descending limb of the loop of Henle. Their presence and regulation are particularly important in the collecting duct, where they are regulated by ADH to control water reabsorption."

          "distal convoluted tubule",
          "collecting ducts"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "proximal convoluted tubule",
        "explanation": "The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is where the majority of reabsorption of water, ions (like sodium, potassium, chloride), glucose, amino acids, and other solutes from the filtrate back into the blood occurs. It is also involved in the secretion of certain waste products and toxins from the blood into the filtrate."
      },
      {
        "question_number": 18,
        "question_text": "The fine tuning of water recovery or disposal occurs in ________.",
        "options": [

          "the distal convoluted tubule"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "the collecting ducts",
        "explanation": "The collecting ducts are primarily responsible for the fine tuning of water reabsorption, which is regulated by the hormone antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH increases the permeability of the collecting ducts to water, allowing more water to be reabsorbed into the blood, thus concentrating the urine and conserving body water."

        "question_number": 19,
        "question_text": "Vasodilation of blood vessels to the kidneys is due to ________.",
        "options": [
          "more frequent action potentials",
          "less frequent action potentials"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "less frequent action potentials",
        "explanation": "The sympathetic nervous system innervates the blood vessels of the kidneys and generally causes vasoconstriction through the release of norepinephrine. Less frequent action potentials from the sympathetic nervous system would lead to less norepinephrine release, resulting in vasodilation of the renal blood vessels."
      },
      {
        "question_number": 20,
        "question_text": "When blood pressure increases, blood vessels supplying the kidney will ________ to mount a steady rate of filtration.",
        "options": [
          "contract",
          "relax"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "contract",
        "explanation": "When blood pressure increases, the afferent arterioles supplying the glomeruli in the kidneys will contract in a process called autoregulation. This helps to maintain a relatively constant glomerular filtration rate (GFR) despite fluctuations in systemic blood pressure, protecting the glomeruli from damage due to high pressure."

          "aldosterone"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "aldosterone",
        "explanation": "Natriuretic hormones, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), promote natriuresis (sodium excretion) and diuresis (water excretion), leading to a decrease in blood volume and pressure. Aldosterone, secreted by the adrenal cortex, has the opposite effect by promoting sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to water retention and increased blood volume and pressure."

          "angiotensin II"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "angiotensin II",
        "explanation": "Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that is produced as part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in response to low blood pressure or low sodium levels. Nitric oxide and bradykinin are vasodilators. Natriuretic hormones also generally promote vasodilation in some contexts."

          "alcohol",
          "milk"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "milk",
        "explanation": "Tea and coffee contain caffeine, which can have a mild diuretic effect. Alcohol inhibits the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to increased urine output. Milk, on the other hand, is hydrating and does not typically have a diuretic effect."

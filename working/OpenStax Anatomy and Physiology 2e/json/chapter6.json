        ],
        "correct_answer": "because it does not have a blood supply",
        "explanation": "Cartilage is avascular, meaning it lacks a direct blood supply. This poor vascularization limits the delivery of nutrients and immune cells to the injured tissue, resulting in slow healing."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "Formation of osteoid spreads out the osteoblasts that formed the ossification centers.",
        "explanation": "Osteocytes originate from osteoblasts. As osteoblasts secrete osteoid (the organic component of bone matrix) around themselves, they become trapped in lacunae and differentiate into osteocytes, thus spreading out within the mineralizing bone tissue."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "They die in the calcified matrix that surrounds them and form the medullary cavity.",
        "explanation": "In endochondral ossification, chondrocytes in the cartilage model hypertrophy (enlarge) and the surrounding matrix calcifies. These chondrocytes then die, leaving behind cavities that are later invaded by osteoblasts to form bone tissue and the medullary cavity."

        "correct_answer": "epiphyseal plate",
        "explanation": "Longitudinal bone growth (increase in length) occurs at the epiphyseal plate (growth plate), a layer of hyaline cartilage located between the diaphysis and each epiphysis. Chondrocytes in this plate proliferate and are then replaced by bone tissue."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "beneath the periosteum",

        "correct_answer": "open and transverse",
        "explanation": "Fractures can be classified based on several criteria. An 'open' fracture (also called compound) means the bone has pierced the skin, while a 'closed' fracture (simple) means the skin is intact. A 'transverse' fracture refers to the direction of the fracture line (perpendicular to the long axis of the bone). Therefore, a fracture can be both open (piercing the skin) and transverse (having a specific fracture line pattern)."

        "explanation": "Wolff's law states that bone will adapt to the loads placed upon it. Increased mechanical stress leads to bone remodeling that increases bone density and thickness in the areas of stress. A right-handed pitcher's throwing arm experiences greater stress, leading to thicker and stronger bones in that arm compared to the non-dominant arm."

        "question_text": "With respect to their direct effects on osseous tissue, which pair of hormones has actions that oppose each other?",
        "options": [
          "estrogen and testosterone",
          "calcitonin and calcitriol",
          "estrogen and progesterone",
          "calcitonin and parathyroid hormone"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "calcitonin and parathyroid hormone",
        "explanation": "Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates osteoclasts to resorb bone, releasing calcium into the blood (increasing blood calcium levels). Calcitonin, released by the thyroid gland, inhibits osteoclast activity and promotes calcium deposition in bone (lowering blood calcium levels). Thus, these two hormones have opposing effects on osseous tissue and calcium homeostasis."

        "question_number": 37,
        "question_text": "When calcium levels are too high or too low, which body system is primarily affected?",
        "options": [
          "skeletal system",
          "endocrine system",
          "digestive system",
          "nervous system"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "nervous system",
        "explanation": "Calcium ions play a critical role in nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction. Therefore, the nervous system is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in blood calcium levels, which can lead to various neurological symptoms if levels are too high or too low."

        "question_number": 38,
        "question_text": "All of the following play a role in calcium homeostasis except",
        "options": [
          "thyroxine",
          "calcitonin",
          "parathyroid hormone",
          "vitamin D"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "thyroxine",
        "explanation": "Calcium homeostasis, the regulation of calcium levels in the blood, is primarily controlled by parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin, and vitamin D. Thyroxine is a thyroid hormone that mainly regulates metabolism and does not have a direct significant role in calcium homeostasis."

        "question_number": 39,
        "question_text": "Which of the following is most likely to be released when blood calcium levels are elevated?",
        "options": [
          "thyroxine",
          "calcitonin",
          "parathyroid hormone",
          "vitamin D"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "calcitonin",
        "explanation": "When blood calcium levels are too high (hypercalcemia), the thyroid gland releases calcitonin. Calcitonin helps to lower blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclast activity (reducing bone resorption) and increasing calcium uptake by bones."

        "explanation": "Receptive aphasia (Wernicke's aphasia) is characterized by difficulty understanding language. People with this condition may hear words but not comprehend their meaning, making it sound like a foreign language. Expressive aphasia (Broca's aphasia) involves difficulty producing language. Conductive aphasia involves difficulty repeating words."

          "garlic",
          "olive oil"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "salt",
        "explanation": "Taste is limited to sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. The complex flavors we perceive are largely due to the combination of taste and smell. Without olfaction, food will taste bland unless it has a strong taste component, such as salt. Thyme, garlic, and olive oil primarily contribute to flavor through their aromas."

          "vestibulocochlear"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "optic",
        "explanation": "The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is a reflex that stabilizes vision during head movements. It involves the vestibular nerve (part of vestibulocochlear, CN VIII), which senses head movement, and the oculomotor (CN III), trochlear (CN IV), and abducens (CN VI) nerves, which control eye movements. The optic nerve (CN II) is involved in vision but not directly in the motor control of eye movements in response to vestibular input for the VOR."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "vagus",
        "explanation": "The gag reflex is primarily mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX), which carries sensory information from the pharynx and tonsils, and the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X), which innervates the muscles of the pharynx and larynx responsible for the gag response."

          "lateral column"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "cerebellar deep white matter",
        "explanation": "The corticospinal pathway is a direct motor pathway from the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord, involved in voluntary movement. It passes through the cerebral peduncles in the midbrain, the medulla (where it decussates in the pyramids), and descends in the lateral column of the spinal cord. The cerebellar deep white matter is part of the cerebellum, which influences motor control but is not a direct component of the corticospinal tract."

          "Romberg test"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "Romberg test",
        "explanation": "Proprioception is the sense of body position and movement. The Romberg test assesses proprioception by evaluating a person's ability to maintain balance when standing with their feet together and eyes closed. The other tests listed assess different aspects of sensory function."

        "correct_answer": "paresis",
        "explanation": "Paresis refers to muscle weakness or partial loss of movement. Paralysis is the complete loss of muscle function. Fasciculations are involuntary muscle twitches. Fibrillations are small, rapid, irregular muscle contractions. Inability to lift the arm above shoulder level indicates weakness."

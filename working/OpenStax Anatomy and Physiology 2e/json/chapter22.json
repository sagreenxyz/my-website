        "explanation": "The trachea (windpipe) has C-shaped rings of hyaline cartilage that provide structural support and prevent collapse. Its posterior wall contains smooth muscle fibers that can contract to adjust the airway diameter. The trachea is lined with a pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium containing cilia that trap and propel mucus and debris away from the lungs."

        "explanation": "The bronchial tree consists of the branching network of airways within the lungs: primary bronchi, secondary bronchi, tertiary bronchi, bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, and respiratory bronchioles. Alveoli are the tiny air sacs at the end of the respiratory bronchioles where gas exchange occurs, but they are not considered part of the 'tree' structure itself."

        "correct_answer": "pulmonary",
        "explanation": "The pulmonary circulation involves the movement of blood from the heart to the lungs for gas exchange. In the pulmonary capillaries surrounding the alveoli, blood picks up oxygen from the inhaled air to be used by the body's cells and releases carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, to be exhaled."

        "correct_answer": "visceral and parietal pleurae.",
        "explanation": "The pleura is a serous membrane that surrounds each lung. It consists of two layers: the visceral pleura, which directly covers the surface of the lung, and the parietal pleura, which lines the thoracic wall, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Between these two layers is the pleural cavity containing a small amount of pleural fluid."

          "resistance",
          "surface tension"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "pulmonary ventilation",
        "explanation": "Pulmonary ventilation, the process of breathing (inhalation and exhalation), relies on the pressure difference between the atmosphere and the alveoli within the lungs. Air flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Changes in the volume of the thoracic cavity, caused by the contraction and relaxation of respiratory muscles, lead to changes in intra-alveolar pressure relative to atmospheric pressure, driving airflow."

          "zero"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "increase in",
        "explanation": "According to Boyle's Law, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume at a constant temperature. Therefore, if the volume of a container holding a gas decreases, the pressure of the gas will increase."

          "transpulmonary pressure"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "transpulmonary pressure",
        "explanation": "Transpulmonary pressure is the pressure difference between the pressure inside the alveoli (intra-alveolar pressure) and the pressure in the pleural cavity (intrapleural pressure). This pressure difference is essential for keeping the lungs inflated and preventing them from collapsing."

          "pressure",
          "airway diameter",
          "friction"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "resistance",
        "explanation": "Gas flow (airflow) is directly proportional to the pressure difference between two points and inversely proportional to the resistance of the airways. Therefore, as resistance to airflow increases, the rate of gas flow decreases, assuming the pressure difference remains constant."

          "The rib cage is compressed.",
          "The thoracic cavity volume decreases.",
          "The ribs and sternum move upward."
        ],
        "correct_answer": "The ribs and sternum move upward.",
        "explanation": "Contraction of the external intercostal muscles, which are located between the ribs, elevates the rib cage. This causes the ribs and sternum to move upward and outward, increasing the anterior-posterior and lateral diameters of the thoracic cavity, which leads to inhalation."

          "expiratory reserve volume",
          "inspiratory reserve volume"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "residual volume",
        "explanation": "Residual volume is the volume of air that remains in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. This air helps to keep the alveoli inflated and prevents them from collapsing. Pulmonary surfactant, produced by Type II alveolar cells, also plays a crucial role in reducing surface tension within the alveoli and preventing their collapse."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "high; low",
        "explanation": "Gases diffuse from an area where their partial pressure is higher to an area where their partial pressure is lower. This movement down the partial pressure gradient is the principle behind gas exchange in the lungs and at the tissues."

          "The capillary dilates.",
          "The partial pressure of oxygen in the affected alveolus increases.",
          "The bronchioles dilate."
        ],
        "correct_answer": "The capillary constricts.",
        "explanation": "When ventilation (airflow into the alveoli) is insufficient, the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in the affected alveolus decreases, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) increases. In response to low alveolar PO2, the pulmonary capillaries supplying that alveolus constrict. This is a mechanism called ventilation-perfusion matching, which helps to redirect blood flow to better-ventilated areas of the lung where oxygen uptake is more efficient."

          "pulmonary ventilation"

        "correct_answer": "internal respiration",
        "explanation": "Internal respiration is the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) between the blood in systemic capillaries and the cells of the body tissues. External respiration (pulmonary respiration) is the exchange of gases in the lungs between the blood and the air in the alveoli. Pulmonary ventilation is simply the mechanical process of breathing (movement of air into and out of the lungs)."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "It diffuses into the alveoli.",
        "explanation": "Gases diffuse from an area of higher partial pressure to an area of lower partial pressure. Since the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) is higher in the blood (45 mm Hg) than in the alveoli (40 mm Hg), carbon dioxide will diffuse from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled."

        "explanation": "The oxygen-hemoglobin saturation/dissociation curve illustrates the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen and the percentage of hemoglobin saturation with oxygen. Several factors can shift this curve, including temperature, blood pH, and the concentration of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) in red blood cells, affecting hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen."

        "correct_answer": "Chloride is exchanged for bicarbonate.",
        "explanation": "The chloride shift is a process that occurs in red blood cells to maintain electrical neutrality during carbon dioxide transport. As bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) are produced inside red blood cells and move out into the plasma, chloride ions (Cl-) move from the plasma into the red blood cells to balance the charge."

        "correct_answer": "hyperventilation",
        "explanation": "Hyperventilation is an increased rate and depth of breathing that exceeds the body's need to remove carbon dioxide. This leads to an excessive removal of CO2 from the blood, causing a decrease in blood carbon dioxide levels and a resulting increase in blood pH (alkalosis)."

        "correct_answer": "low partial pressure of oxygen",
        "explanation": "Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) can be triggered or worsened by exercise at high altitudes due to the already low partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere. The increased metabolic demands of exercise exacerbate the effects of hypoxia (low oxygen levels)."

        "explanation": "Type II alveolar cells produce pulmonary surfactant, which reduces surface tension in the alveoli, preventing them from collapsing. Premature babies may not have produced enough surfactant, leading to increased surface tension and difficulty in inflating the lungs, a condition known as infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS)."

          "stratum basale"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "stratum basale",
        "explanation": "The papillary layer of the dermis interlocks with the stratum basale of the epidermis through dermal papillae and epidermal ridges, providing a strong connection between the two layers."

          "a site to long-term energy storage"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "source of blood vessels in the epidermis",
        "explanation": "The hypodermis (subcutaneous tissue) protects underlying organs, helps insulate the body to maintain temperature, and serves as a site for long-term energy storage in the form of adipose tissue. However, the epidermis is avascular, and its blood supply comes from vessels in the underlying dermis."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "are responsible for goose bumps",
        "explanation": "Arrector pili are small muscles attached to hair follicles. When stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., in response to cold or fear), they contract, causing the hair to stand up and creating goose bumps on the skin surface."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "are associated with hair follicles",
        "explanation": "Sebaceous glands are exocrine glands that secrete sebum, an oily substance, into hair follicles. This helps to lubricate the hair and skin, preventing them from drying out."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "folic acid synthesis",
        "explanation": "The stratum lucidum provides an extra layer of protection in thick skin. Desmosomes are cell junctions that provide structural integrity to the epidermis, contributing to its barrier function. Merkel cells are sensory receptors. Folic acid (folate) synthesis is not a function of the integumentary system; vitamin D synthesis is."

        "options": [
          "are easily treatable and not a major health concern",
          "occur due to poor hygiene",
          "can be reduced by limiting exposure to the sun",
          "affect only the epidermis"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "can be reduced by limiting exposure to the sun",
        "explanation": "Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is a major risk factor for the development of various types of skin cancer. Limiting sun exposure and using sun protection can significantly reduce the risk. While some skin cancers are easily treatable, others can be aggressive and life-threatening. Skin cancers can originate in different layers of the skin, not just the epidermis. Poor hygiene is not a direct cause of skin cancer."

          "can result from deep massages",
          "are preventable by eliminating pressure points",
          "are caused by dry skin"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "are preventable by eliminating pressure points",
        "explanation": "Bedsores, also known as pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, are caused by prolonged pressure on the skin that restricts blood flow, leading to tissue damage. Preventing these by regularly changing position and eliminating pressure points is crucial. While moisturizers can help maintain skin integrity, they don't address the primary cause. Deep massage over pressure points can potentially worsen the condition. Dry skin can be a contributing factor but is not the sole cause."

          "epidermis and dermis"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "epidermis and dermis",
        "explanation": "Sunburn with blistering is classified as a second-degree burn. Second-degree burns involve damage to both the epidermis and the dermis, leading to pain, redness, and the formation of blisters as fluid collects between these layers."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "increased production of connective tissue",
        "explanation": "Following the formation of a blood clot, the next phase of wound healing involves inflammation and the migration of fibroblasts to the injured area. These fibroblasts then begin to produce collagen and other components of connective tissue to repair the damaged tissue."

Hydrogen bonds are weak attractions between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an electronegative atom (like O, N, or F) and another electronegative atom.

Once those are depleted, they would attempt to break down glycogen through glycolysis to produce ATP. However, this process ultimately requires the regeneration of ATP from ADP, so the drug would severely limit the muscle's ability to sustain activity. While glycogen can be used, the blockage of ATP regeneration will still lead to functional impairment."

                "explanation": "A molecule of hemoglobin is composed of four globin protein subunits (typically two alpha and two beta chains), and each subunit is bound to a heme molecule. Each heme molecule contains an iron ion that can bind one molecule of oxygen, so one hemoglobin molecule can carry up to four oxygen molecules."

                "explanation": "Cardiac output is the product of heart rate and stroke volume. While an increase in heart rate generally increases cardiac output, if the heart rate becomes too rapid (typically above 160-180 bpm), there is less time for the ventricles to fill with blood during diastole. This can lead to a decrease in stroke volume, and if the decrease in stroke volume is significant enough, it can outweigh the increase in heart rate, resulting in a net decrease in cardiac output."

This compliance helps to smooth out pressure fluctuations and maintain continuous blood flow."

                "explanation": "Blood flow is directly proportional to blood pressure and inversely proportional to resistance. According to Poiseuille's law, resistance is directly proportional to the length of the vessel and the viscosity of the blood. Therefore, the longer the vessel, the higher the resistance and the lower the flow. Increased viscosity also increases resistance and decreases flow. A decrease in blood volume leads to a decrease in blood pressure and consequently, a decrease in blood flow."

                "explanation": "Pulmonary ventilation, the process of breathing (inhalation and exhalation), relies on the pressure difference between the atmosphere and the alveoli within the lungs. Air flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Changes in the volume of the thoracic cavity, caused by the contraction and relaxation of respiratory muscles, lead to changes in intra-alveolar pressure relative to atmospheric pressure, driving airflow."

The body will attempt to compensate by increasing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) through hypoventilation to lower the pH back towards normal. Therefore, increased pH, increased pCO2 (as compensation), and increased HCO3\u2013 are characteristic of metabolic alkalosis."

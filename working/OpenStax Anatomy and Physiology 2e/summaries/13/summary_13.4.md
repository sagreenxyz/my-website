# Summary: 13.4 The Peripheral Nervous System

This section describes the components of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which includes all neural structures outside the brain and spinal cord: sensory receptors, peripheral nerves, ganglia, and motor endings.

## Sensory Receptors:

*   Specialized structures responding to stimuli (changes in the environment). Activation results in graded potentials that may trigger nerve impulses (APs).
*   **Classification by Stimulus Type:**
    *   **Mechanoreceptors:** Respond to mechanical force (touch, pressure, vibration, stretch).
    *   **Thermoreceptors:** Respond to temperature changes.
    *   **Photoreceptors:** Respond to light energy (retina).
    *   **Chemoreceptors:** Respond to chemicals in solution (smell, taste, blood chemistry).
    *   **Nociceptors:** Respond to potentially damaging stimuli (pain).
*   **Classification by Location:**
    *   **Exteroceptors:** Sensitive to stimuli arising outside the body (touch, pressure, pain, temperature receptors in skin; special senses).
    *   **Interoceptors (Visceroceptors):** Respond to stimuli within the body (internal viscera, blood vessels). Monitor chemical changes, tissue stretch, temperature.
    *   **Proprioceptors:** Respond to internal stimuli located in skeletal muscles, tendons, joints, ligaments, and connective tissue coverings. Monitor body position and movement.
*   **Classification by Structure:**
    *   **Simple Receptors (General Senses):** Modified dendritic endings of sensory neurons (most receptors). Found throughout body; monitor touch, pressure, stretch, vibration, temperature, pain, proprioception. Can be unencapsulated (free nerve endings, Merkel discs, hair follicle receptors) or encapsulated (Meissner's corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, Ruffini endings, muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs).
    *   **Complex Receptors (Special Senses):** Localized collections of cells associated with special senses (vision, hearing, equilibrium, smell, taste). Housed in complex sense organs.

## Nerves:

*   Cordlike bundles of peripheral axons enclosed by connective tissue sheaths. Part of the PNS.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Endoneurium:** Surrounds individual axons (and myelin sheath if present).
    *   **Perineurium:** Bundles axons into fascicles.
    *   **Epineurium:** Tough fibrous sheath enclosing all fascicles to form the nerve.
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Sensory (Afferent) Nerves:** Carry impulses only *towards* CNS.
    *   **Motor (Efferent) Nerves:** Carry impulses only *away from* CNS.
    *   **Mixed Nerves:** Contain both sensory and motor fibers (most common); transmit impulses both to and from CNS.
*   **Cranial Nerves:** 12 pairs arising from the brain. Serve head and neck primarily (except Vagus nerve). See Ch 16.3 for details.
*   **Spinal Nerves:** 31 pairs arising from the spinal cord. Named according to point of issue (8 Cervical, 12 Thoracic, 5 Lumbar, 5 Sacral, 1 Coccygeal). All are mixed nerves.
    *   **Roots:** Connect each spinal nerve to the cord (Dorsal root - sensory; Ventral root - motor). Roots merge to form spinal nerve.
    *   **Rami:** Spinal nerve branches after exiting intervertebral foramen (Dorsal ramus - supplies posterior body trunk; Ventral ramus - supplies rest of trunk and limbs). Ventral rami (except T2-T12) form interlacing networks called **nerve plexuses** (cervical, brachial, lumbar, sacral).
    *   **Dermatomes:** Area of skin innervated by cutaneous branches of a single spinal nerve.

## Ganglia:

*   Collections of neuron cell bodies associated with nerves in the PNS.
*   **Dorsal Root Ganglia (Sensory Ganglia):** Contain cell bodies of sensory neurons.
*   **Autonomic Ganglia:** Contain cell bodies of autonomic motor neurons.

## Motor Endings:

*   PNS elements activating effectors by releasing neurotransmitters.
*   **Neuromuscular Junctions:** Innervation of skeletal muscle.
*   **Varicosities:** Innervation of smooth muscle and glands (autonomic motor endings).

## Regeneration of Nerve Fibers:

*   Mature neurons are amitotic, but damaged peripheral axons can regenerate if the cell body remains intact.
*   Process involves Schwann cells forming a regeneration tube to guide axon growth. CNS axons typically do not regenerate effectively due to inhibitory factors and lack of Schwann cells.

The PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body, mediating sensory input and motor output.

# Summary: 13.2 The Central Nervous System

This section provides an overview of the major components of the adult central nervous system (CNS): the brain and spinal cord, focusing on their structure and general functions.

## The Brain:

*   Occupies the cranial cavity; control center for the nervous system.
*   **Four Major Regions:**
    1.  **Cerebral Hemispheres (Cerebrum):**
        *   Largest part, forms superior aspect. Left and right hemispheres separated by longitudinal fissure, connected by corpus callosum.
        *   Surface marked by gyri (ridges), sulci (shallow grooves), and fissures (deep grooves).
        *   Divided into lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, insula) named after overlying cranial bones.
        *   **Cerebral Cortex:** Outer layer of gray matter (neuron cell bodies, dendrites, unmyelinated axons, glia). Site of conscious mind: awareness, sensory perception, voluntary motor initiation, communication, memory, understanding. Organized into functional areas (motor, sensory, association).
        *   **White Matter:** Deep to cortex; myelinated fiber tracts responsible for communication between cerebral areas and between cortex and lower CNS centers.
        *   **Basal Nuclei (Ganglia):** Islands of gray matter deep within white matter. Involved in motor control (starting/stopping movements, regulating intensity), attention, cognition.
    2.  **Diencephalon:** Central core, surrounded by cerebral hemispheres. Consists of:
        *   **Thalamus:** Major relay station for sensory information ascending to the cerebral cortex. Sorts, edits, and relays inputs.
        *   **Hypothalamus:** Main visceral control center; regulates ANS activity, body temperature, food intake, water balance, sleep-wake cycles, endocrine system function (via pituitary gland).
        *   **Epithalamus:** Contains pineal gland (secretes melatonin, regulates sleep-wake cycle).
    3.  **Brain Stem:** Connects cerebrum and spinal cord. Controls automatic behaviors necessary for survival. Consists of:
        *   **Midbrain:** Visual/auditory reflexes, motor control pathways.
        *   **Pons:** Relays information between cerebrum and cerebellum; helps regulate breathing.
        *   **Medulla Oblongata:** Continuous with spinal cord. Autonomic reflex center (cardiovascular, respiratory, vomiting, swallowing).
    4.  **Cerebellum:** Dorsal to pons and medulla. Coordinates voluntary movement, posture, balance, equilibrium. Processes input from cortex, brainstem, sensory receptors for smooth, coordinated movements.

## The Spinal Cord:

*   Located in the vertebral canal, extending from foramen magnum to L1/L2 vertebra.
*   Provides two-way conduction pathway between brain and body. Major reflex center.
*   Protected by vertebrae, meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Gray Matter:** Inner H-shaped region (cell bodies, dendrites, unmyelinated axons). Dorsal (posterior) horns (interneurons, sensory axons), Ventral (anterior) horns (somatic motor neuron cell bodies), Lateral horns (autonomic motor neurons, thoracic/lumbar regions).
    *   **White Matter:** Outer region (myelinated and unmyelinated axons). Divided into funiculi (dorsal, lateral, ventral) containing ascending (sensory) and descending (motor) tracts.
    *   **Central Canal:** Runs length of cord, contains CSF.
*   **Spinal Nerves:** 31 pairs attach to cord via dorsal (sensory) and ventral (motor) roots.

The CNS is the complex integration and command center of the nervous system.

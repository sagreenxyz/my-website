# Summary: 3.1 The Cell Membrane

This section describes the structure and function of the plasma membrane, the outer boundary of the cell, which regulates the passage of substances into and out of the cell.

## Structure (Fluid Mosaic Model):

*   **Phospholipid Bilayer:** Basic framework. Two layers of phospholipids arranged tail-to-tail.
    *   **Hydrophilic Heads:** Polar phosphate heads face the watery environments inside (cytosol) and outside (interstitial fluid) the cell.
    *   **Hydrophobic Tails:** Nonpolar fatty acid tails face inward, creating a barrier to water-soluble substances.
*   **Membrane Proteins:** Embedded within or attached to the bilayer; perform most membrane functions.
    *   **Integral Proteins:** Firmly embedded, often transmembrane (span the entire membrane). Function as channels, carriers, receptors, enzymes.
    *   **Peripheral Proteins:** Loosely attached to integral proteins or lipids on either surface. Function as enzymes, structural support, cell links.
*   **Cholesterol:** Steroid lipid interspersed among phospholipid tails. Stabilizes the membrane, affects fluidity.
*   **Glycocalyx:** Carbohydrate-rich layer on the outer surface (glycolipids and glycoproteins). Functions in cell recognition, adhesion, signaling, protection.

## Functions:

*   **Physical Barrier:** Separates intracellular fluid (ICF) from extracellular fluid (ECF).
*   **Selective Permeability:** Controls entry and exit of ions and molecules. Permeable to small, nonpolar, lipid-soluble substances (O2, CO2, fats). Impermeable to ions and large, polar, water-soluble molecules (glucose, amino acids) without assistance.
*   **Communication:** Contains receptors for chemical signals (hormones, neurotransmitters).
*   **Cell Recognition:** Glycocalyx provides unique identity markers.
*   **Electrochemical Gradient:** Establishes and maintains differences in charge and ion concentration across the membrane (membrane potential), important for nerve and muscle function.

## Membrane Transport:

*   **Passive Processes:** Do not require cellular energy (ATP). Substances move down their concentration gradient (high to low).
    *   **Simple Diffusion:** Movement of lipid-soluble substances directly through the bilayer (e.g., O2, CO2).
    *   **Facilitated Diffusion:** Movement of specific substances (e.g., glucose, ions) across the membrane with the help of membrane proteins (channels or carriers).
    *   **Osmosis:** Diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of higher water concentration (lower solute concentration) to an area of lower water concentration (higher solute concentration).
        *   **Tonicity:** Ability of a solution to change cell volume by altering water content (Isotonic, Hypertonic, Hypotonic solutions).
*   **Active Processes:** Require cellular energy (ATP) to move substances across the membrane. Can move substances *against* their concentration gradient (low to high).
    *   **Active Transport:** Uses carrier proteins (pumps) powered by ATP hydrolysis (e.g., Sodium-Potassium pump).
        *   **Primary Active Transport:** Energy from ATP hydrolysis directly drives the pump.
        *   **Secondary Active Transport:** Energy stored in an ionic gradient (created by primary active transport) drives the transport of another substance.
    *   **Vesicular Transport:** Transport of large particles, macromolecules, and fluids across the membrane inside membranous sacs called vesicles. Requires ATP.
        *   **Endocytosis:** Bringing substances *into* the cell (Phagocytosis - cell eating, Pinocytosis - cell drinking, Receptor-mediated endocytosis - specific).
        *   **Exocytosis:** Moving substances *out* of the cell. Vesicle fuses with plasma membrane, releasing contents.

## Check Your Understanding

1.  Describe the basic structure of the phospholipid bilayer. How do its hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions contribute to membrane function?
2.  What are the two main types of membrane proteins, and how do they differ in their association with the membrane?

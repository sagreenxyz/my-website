# Summary: 3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication

This section describes the structure and function of the nucleus, the cell's control center, and the process of DNA replication, which ensures genetic information is passed on during cell division.

## The Nucleus:

*   **Function:** Contains the cell's genetic material (DNA) organized as chromosomes; controls cell activities by regulating protein synthesis; dictates cell structure and function.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Nuclear Envelope:** Double membrane barrier surrounding the nucleus, continuous with the ER. Outer membrane may have ribosomes.
    *   **Nuclear Pores:** Regulate passage of molecules (e.g., proteins, RNA) between the nucleus and cytoplasm.
    *   **Nucleolus (plural: Nucleoli):** Dark-staining body(ies) within the nucleus. Site of ribosome subunit synthesis.
    *   **Chromatin:** Complex of DNA wrapped around histone proteins. Exists in a dispersed state when the cell is not dividing, allowing access for transcription. Condenses into visible **chromosomes** during cell division.
        *   **Chromosomes:** Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) in somatic cells. Each contains thousands of genes.

## DNA Replication:

*   **Purpose:** Process of accurately duplicating the entire DNA content before cell division (occurs during the S phase of interphase). Ensures daughter cells receive identical genetic information.
*   **Mechanism:** Semi-conservative replication (each new DNA molecule consists of one old strand and one newly synthesized strand).
    1.  **Unwinding:** Enzymes (helicase) unwind the DNA double helix and separate the two nucleotide strands at replication forks.
    2.  **Priming:** RNA primers are synthesized to provide a starting point for DNA polymerase.
    3.  **Synthesis:** DNA polymerase enzymes add complementary nucleotides to each template strand (A pairs with T, G pairs with C), synthesizing new strands in the 5' to 3' direction.
        *   **Leading Strand:** Synthesized continuously towards the replication fork.
        *   **Lagging Strand:** Synthesized discontinuously in short segments (Okazaki fragments) away from the replication fork.
    4.  **Ligation:** RNA primers are replaced with DNA nucleotides, and Okazaki fragments are joined together by DNA ligase.
*   **Result:** Two identical DNA double helices are formed from the original one. Each new molecule is attached to its "sister" molecule at the centromere, forming sister chromatids.

1.  What are the main functions of the cell nucleus?
2.  Describe the structure of the nuclear envelope and the role of nuclear pores.
3.  What is chromatin, and how does it relate to chromosomes?
4.  Briefly explain the overall process of DNA replication, including the roles of helicase and DNA polymerase.
5.  Why is DNA replication referred to as "semiconservative"?

The nucleus houses the genetic blueprint, and DNA replication ensures its faithful transmission to subsequent cell generations.

# Summary: Chapter 3 Chapter Review - The Cellular Level of Organization

This chapter review consolidates the information presented about the structure and function of human cells.

## Key Concepts Recapped:

*   **3.1 The Cell Membrane:** Describes the fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane, including the phospholipid bilayer, embedded proteins (integral, peripheral), cholesterol, and the glycocalyx. Explains its role in boundary maintenance, communication, and selective permeability.
*   **3.2 Transport Across the Cell Membrane:** Covers passive processes (simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis) driven by concentration gradients and active processes (primary/secondary active transport, vesicular transport: endocytosis [phagocytosis, pinocytosis, receptor-mediated] and exocytosis) requiring ATP. Discusses tonicity (isotonic, hypertonic, hypotonic solutions).
*   **3.3 Cytoplasm and Organelles:** Details the composition of cytoplasm (cytosol and organelles). Describes the structure and specific functions of major organelles: mitochondria (ATP synthesis), ribosomes (protein synthesis), rough ER (protein modification/synthesis), smooth ER (lipid synthesis, detoxification), Golgi apparatus (processing/packaging), lysosomes (digestion), peroxisomes (detoxification), and components of the cytoskeleton (microfilaments, intermediate filaments, microtubules) for support and movement. Includes centrioles, cilia, and flagella.
*   **3.4 The Nucleus:** Explains the structure of the nucleus (nuclear envelope, nucleoli, chromatin) and its role as the cell's control center, housing DNA. Briefly outlines protein synthesis (transcription in the nucleus, translation in the cytoplasm).
*   **3.5 Cell Growth and Division:** Describes the cell cycle, including Interphase (G1, S, G2 phases - growth and DNA replication) and the M phase (mitosis - prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase; and cytokinesis). Explains the purpose of mitosis for growth and repair.
*   **3.6 Cellular Differentiation:** Introduces the concept of how cells specialize to perform specific functions, leading to the diverse cell types found in the body.

The chapter emphasizes the cell as the basic structural and functional unit of the human body.

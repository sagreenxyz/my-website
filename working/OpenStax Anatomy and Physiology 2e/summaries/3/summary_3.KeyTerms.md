# Summary: Chapter 3 Key Terms

This section lists important terminology related to the cellular level of organization discussed in Chapter 3.

*(Note: The specific terms are derived from the HTML content provided previously. Below is a representation of the types of terms typically found.)*

*   **Active Transport:** Membrane transport requiring energy (ATP) to move substances against their concentration gradient.
*   **Anaphase:** Stage of mitosis where sister chromatids separate.
*   **Cell Cycle:** The life cycle of a dividing cell, including interphase and the mitotic phase.
*   **Cell Membrane (Plasma Membrane):** Outer boundary of the cell, regulating passage of substances.
*   **Centriole:** Organelle involved in cell division.
*   **Chromatin:** DNA and associated proteins in a dispersed state within the nucleus.
*   **Chromosome:** Condensed structure of DNA and proteins formed during cell division.
*   **Cilia:** Short, hair-like projections from the cell surface used for moving substances across the surface.
*   **Cytokinesis:** Division of the cytoplasm following mitosis.
*   **Cytoplasm:** Contents of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nucleus (cytosol + organelles).
*   **Cytoskeleton:** Network of protein filaments (microtubules, microfilaments, intermediate filaments) providing structural support and enabling movement.
*   **Cytosol:** The fluid portion of the cytoplasm.
*   **Diffusion:** Passive movement of substances from higher to lower concentration.
*   **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):** Genetic material found in the nucleus.
*   **Endocytosis:** Process by which the cell takes in material via vesicle formation (phagocytosis, pinocytosis, receptor-mediated).
*   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):** Network of membranes involved in synthesis and transport (Rough ER: protein synthesis/modification; Smooth ER: lipid synthesis, detoxification).
*   **Exocytosis:** Process by which the cell releases material via vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane.
*   **Facilitated Diffusion:** Passive transport across a membrane with the help of a membrane protein.
*   **Flagellum:** Long, whip-like projection used for cell locomotion (e.g., sperm).
*   **Gene:** A segment of DNA that codes for a functional product (RNA or protein).
*   **Golgi Apparatus (Complex):** Organelle that modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids.
*   **Interphase:** Period of the cell cycle involving growth (G1), DNA replication (S), and preparation for division (G2).
*   **Lysosome:** Organelle containing digestive enzymes.
*   **Metaphase:** Stage of mitosis where chromosomes align at the cell's equator.
*   **Microvilli:** Finger-like extensions of the plasma membrane that increase surface area.
*   **Mitochondrion (plural: Mitochondria):** Organelle responsible for ATP production through cellular respiration.
*   **Mitosis:** Process of nuclear division resulting in two genetically identical daughter nuclei.
*   **Nucleolus:** Structure within the nucleus involved in ribosome synthesis.
*   **Nucleus:** Central organelle containing the cell's genetic material.
*   **Organelle:** Specialized structure within a cell performing a specific function.
*   **Osmosis:** Diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane.
*   **Passive Transport:** Membrane transport that does not require cellular energy.
*   **Peroxisome:** Organelle involved in metabolic processes, including detoxification.
*   **Phospholipid Bilayer:** The fundamental structure of the plasma membrane.
*   **Prophase:** First stage of mitosis where chromatin condenses into chromosomes.
*   **Ribosome:** Site of protein synthesis.
*   **RNA (Ribonucleic Acid):** Nucleic acid involved in protein synthesis (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA).
*   **Sodium-Potassium Pump:** Example of primary active transport.
*   **Telophase:** Final stage of mitosis where chromosomes decondense and nuclear envelopes reform.
*   **Transcription:** Synthesis of RNA from a DNA template.
*   **Translation:** Synthesis of protein from an mRNA template.

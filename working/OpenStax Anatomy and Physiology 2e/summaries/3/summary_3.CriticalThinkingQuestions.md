# Summary: Chapter 3 Critical Thinking Questions

This section presents questions designed to stimulate deeper thought and application of the concepts covered in Chapter 3 regarding the cell. These questions likely require students to:

*   Analyze the relationship between cell structure and function (e.g., how does the structure of mitochondria relate to its role in ATP production?).
*   Compare and contrast different cellular processes (e.g., differentiate between passive and active transport, or mitosis and cytokinesis).
*   Predict the consequences of organelle malfunction or defects in cellular processes (e.g., what happens if lysosomes fail? What if DNA replication has errors?).
*   Apply knowledge of cellular biology to explain physiological phenomena or disease states (e.g., relate membrane transport issues to cystic fibrosis).
*   Integrate concepts like protein synthesis and membrane transport.

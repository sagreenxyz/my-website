# Summary: 3.4 Protein Synthesis

This section explains the process by which the genetic information encoded in DNA is used to direct the synthesis of proteins, the workhorses of the cell. It involves two main stages: transcription and translation.

## The Genetic Code:

*   DNA contains the instructions for building proteins, written as a sequence of nucleotide bases (A, T, C, G).
*   Information is read in groups of three bases called **codons**. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid, or a start/stop signal.
*   The code is degenerate (most amino acids are specified by more than one codon) but unambiguous (each codon specifies only one amino acid).

## Transcription (DNA → mRNA):

*   **Purpose:** To transfer the genetic information from a DNA gene sequence to a complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule.
*   **Location:** Nucleus.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Initiation:** RNA polymerase binds to a specific DNA sequence called the **promoter** upstream of the gene, unwinding the DNA locally.
    2.  **Elongation:** RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template strand, synthesizing a complementary pre-mRNA strand using RNA nucleotides (A pairs with U, G pairs with C).
    3.  **Termination:** Transcription stops when RNA polymerase reaches a **terminator** sequence on the DNA. The pre-mRNA molecule detaches.
*   **RNA Processing (Eukaryotes):** Before leaving the nucleus, pre-mRNA is processed into mature mRNA:
    *   **Splicing:** Non-coding regions (**introns**) are removed, and coding regions (**exons**) are joined together.
    *   **Capping:** A modified guanine nucleotide cap is added to the 5' end.
    *   **Polyadenylation:** A poly-A tail (adenine nucleotides) is added to the 3' end. These modifications protect mRNA and aid export/translation.

## Translation (mRNA → Protein):

*   **Purpose:** To decode the mRNA sequence into a sequence of amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain (protein).
*   **Location:** Cytoplasm, on ribosomes.
*   **Players:**
    *   **mRNA:** Carries the genetic code from the nucleus.
    *   **Ribosomes:** Provide the site for translation; catalyze peptide bond formation. Composed of large and small subunits.
    *   **Transfer RNA (tRNA):** Molecules that transport specific amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA has an **anticodon** (complementary to an mRNA codon) and carries the corresponding amino acid.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Initiation:** The small ribosomal subunit binds to mRNA; the initiator tRNA (carrying methionine) binds to the start codon (AUG); the large ribosomal subunit joins, forming a functional ribosome.
    2.  **Elongation:** The ribosome moves along the mRNA one codon at a time.
        *   A tRNA with a complementary anticodon binds to the codon in the A site (aminoacyl site).
        *   A peptide bond forms between the amino acid in the A site and the growing polypeptide chain held by the tRNA in the P site (peptidyl site).
        *   The ribosome translocates: the tRNA in the P site moves to the E site (exit site) and is released; the tRNA in the A site moves to the P site. The A site is now ready for the next tRNA.
    3.  **Termination:** Elongation continues until a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) enters the A site. A release factor binds, causing the polypeptide chain to detach from the tRNA and the ribosomal subunits to separate.

Protein synthesis is the central process linking genes (DNA) to cellular function (proteins). The synthesized polypeptide may undergo further folding and modification to become a functional protein.

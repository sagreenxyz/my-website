# Summary: 3.2 The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles

This section describes the components of the cell between the plasma membrane and the nucleus, including the cytosol, organelles, and cytoskeleton.

## Components of Cytoplasm:

*   **Cytosol:** The viscous, semi-transparent fluid portion of the cytoplasm, largely water with dissolved solutes (proteins, salts, sugars, etc.). Site of many chemical reactions.
*   **Organelles:** Specialized subcellular structures performing specific functions for the cell. Can be membranous or non-membranous.
*   **Inclusions:** Chemical substances that may be present, depending on cell type (e.g., stored nutrients like glycogen granules, lipid droplets; pigment granules).

## Membranous Organelles:

*   **Mitochondria:** "Powerhouse" of the cell. Double membrane structure; inner membrane folded into cristae. Site of aerobic cellular respiration, generating most of the cell's ATP. Contain their own DNA and ribosomes.
*   **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):** Network of interconnected membranes (cisternae) continuous with the nuclear envelope.
    *   **Rough ER (RER):** Studded with ribosomes. Synthesizes proteins destined for secretion, insertion into membranes, or delivery to lysosomes/organelles. Modifies and packages proteins.
    *   **Smooth ER (SER):** Lacks ribosomes. Involved in lipid synthesis (steroids, phospholipids), detoxification of drugs/poisons, calcium storage (muscle cells), glycogen breakdown.
*   **Golgi Apparatus (Complex):** Stack of flattened membranous sacs (cisternae). Modifies, concentrates, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids received from the ER for secretion, insertion into membranes, or transport to other organelles (e.g., lysosomes). Forms secretory vesicles and lysosomes.
*   **Peroxisomes:** Small sacs containing powerful oxidase and catalase enzymes. Detoxify harmful substances (e.g., alcohol, free radicals). Break down fatty acids.
*   **Lysosomes:** Spherical sacs containing digestive (hydrolytic) enzymes. Digest ingested bacteria, viruses, toxins; degrade nonfunctional organelles (autophagy); break down stored molecules; involved in apoptosis (programmed cell death).

## Non-Membranous Organelles:

*   **Ribosomes:** Sites of protein synthesis. Composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and protein. Can be free in cytosol (synthesize cytosolic proteins) or bound to Rough ER (synthesize proteins for export/membranes/lysosomes).
*   **Cytoskeleton:** Network of protein filaments throughout the cytosol. Provides structural support, maintains cell shape, organizes organelles, involved in cell movement and intracellular transport. Components:
    *   **Microfilaments:** Thinnest (e.g., actin). Involved in muscle contraction, cell motility, changes in cell shape, endo/exocytosis.
    *   **Intermediate Filaments:** Tough, rope-like fibers. Resist mechanical stress, stabilize organelles (e.g., keratin).
    *   **Microtubules:** Largest diameter; hollow tubes (e.g., tubulin). Determine overall cell shape, distribution of organelles; form cilia, flagella, centrioles, mitotic spindle. Involved in intracellular transport (motor proteins).
*   **Centrosome and Centrioles:** Centrosome is microtubule organizing center near nucleus. Contains paired centrioles (barrel-shaped structures formed by microtubules). Form mitotic spindle during cell division; form bases of cilia and flagella.

## Cellular Extensions:

*   **Cilia:** Short, hair-like projections containing microtubules. Move substances across cell surfaces (e.g., mucus in respiratory tract).
*   **Flagella:** Longer projections containing microtubules. Propel the whole cell (only sperm in humans).
*   **Microvilli:** Finger-like extensions of the plasma membrane. Increase surface area for absorption (e.g., intestinal lining). Contain actin core.

The cytoplasm and its organelles work together to carry out the essential functions of the cell.

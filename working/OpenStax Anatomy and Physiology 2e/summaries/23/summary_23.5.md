# Summary: 23.5 The Small and Large Intestines

This section details the anatomy and functions of the small and large intestines, the primary sites for digestion/absorption and water absorption/waste elimination, respectively.

## Small Intestine:

*   **Function:** Major site for chemical digestion and nutrient absorption (~90%).
*   **Location:** Extends from the pyloric sphincter (stomach) to the ileocecal valve (large intestine). ~2-4 m long in life (longer postmortem).
*   **Subdivisions:**
    1.  **Duodenum:** (~25 cm) Shortest section, C-shaped, curves around head of pancreas. Receives chyme from stomach, bile from liver/gallbladder, and pancreatic juice from pancreas via the hepatopancreatic ampulla. Site of most active digestion.
    2.  **Jejunum:** (~2.5 m) Middle section, primary site of nutrient absorption.
    3.  **Ileum:** (~3.6 m) Final section, joins large intestine at ileocecal valve. Mainly absorbs vitamin B12, bile salts, and remaining nutrients. Contains Peyer's patches (lymphoid tissue).
*   **Structural Modifications for Absorption (Increase Surface Area):**
    1.  **Circular Folds (Plicae Circulares):** Deep, permanent folds of mucosa and submucosa. Slow chyme movement, increase surface area ~3x.
    2.  **Villi:** Fingerlike projections of the mucosa (~1 mm high). Increase surface area ~10x. Core contains capillary bed and a lacteal (lymphatic capillary). Epithelium is simple columnar with absorptive cells (enterocytes) and goblet cells.
    3.  **Microvilli:** Tiny projections of the plasma membrane of absorptive cells (enterocytes), forming a "brush border." Increase surface area ~20x. Contain brush border enzymes for final digestion.
*   **Intestinal Juice:** Secreted by intestinal crypts (glands). ~1-2 L/day. Largely water, some mucus, slightly alkaline. Carrier fluid for absorbing nutrients from chyme.
*   **Motility:**
    *   **Segmentation:** Primary movement after a meal. Localized contractions mix chyme with digestive juices and facilitate absorption. Does not propel chyme forward significantly.
    *   **Peristalsis (Migrating Motor Complex - MMC):** Begins after most absorption is complete. Waves of contraction sweep undigested material towards large intestine.

## Large Intestine:

*   **Function:** Absorb remaining water, electrolytes, and vitamins (produced by gut bacteria); store feces; eliminate feces (defecation).
*   **Location:** Frames the small intestine; extends from ileocecal valve to anus.
*   **Subdivisions:**
    1.  **Cecum:** Blind pouch below ileocecal valve. **Appendix** attached (lymphoid tissue).
    2.  **Colon:** Ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon (S-shaped).
    3.  **Rectum:** Straight tube connecting sigmoid colon to anal canal.
    4.  **Anal Canal:** Final segment; opens to exterior at the **anus**. Has two sphincters: internal (involuntary smooth muscle) and external (voluntary skeletal muscle).
*   **Unique Features:**
    *   **Teniae Coli:** Three bands of longitudinal smooth muscle in the muscularis.
    *   **Haustra:** Pocket-like sacs caused by the tone of the teniae coli.
    *   **Epiploic (Omental) Appendages:** Small fat-filled pouches of visceral peritoneum.
*   **Microscopic Anatomy:** Simple columnar epithelium (except stratified squamous in anal canal). Abundant goblet cells for mucus secretion. No circular folds, villi, or significant enzyme secretion. Deeper crypts.
*   **Bacterial Flora (Gut Microbiome):** Ferment indigestible carbohydrates (producing gas), synthesize B complex vitamins and vitamin K, metabolize some host molecules (e.g., bile salts), prevent pathogenic bacteria growth.
*   **Motility:**
    *   **Haustral Churning:** Slow segmenting movements within haustra, mixing contents.
    *   **Mass Movements (Mass Peristalsis):** Long, slow-moving, powerful contractile waves that move over large areas of the colon 3-4 times daily, forcing contents towards the rectum. Often triggered by food in the stomach (gastrocolic reflex).
*   **Defecation:** Mass movements force feces into rectum, initiating the defecation reflex (spinal cord reflex). Stretching of rectal wall signals CNS. Parasympathetic signals cause sigmoid colon and rectum contraction, internal sphincter relaxation. External sphincter under voluntary control allows conscious decision to defecate. Valsalva's maneuver aids expulsion.

The small intestine is highly adapted for digestion and absorption with a vast surface area, while the large intestine primarily absorbs water and electrolytes and eliminates indigestible waste.

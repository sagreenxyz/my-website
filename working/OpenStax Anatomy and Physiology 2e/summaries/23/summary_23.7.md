# Summary: 23.7 Chemical Digestion and Absorption: A Closer Look

This section provides a detailed examination of the chemical breakdown (digestion) of specific nutrient classes (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids) and their subsequent absorption mechanisms across the GI tract lining, primarily in the small intestine.

## Chemical Digestion:

*   **Definition:** Enzymatic breakdown of large food molecules into smaller, absorbable monomers.
*   **Mechanism:** Hydrolysis (addition of water to break bonds).
*   **Enzymes:** Specific enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of each nutrient class. Many are secreted in inactive forms (zymogens) and activated in the GI lumen.

## Carbohydrate Digestion and Absorption:

*   **Molecules:** Polysaccharides (starch, glycogen), disaccharides (sucrose, lactose, maltose), monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose - absorbable form).
*   **Digestion:**
    *   *Mouth:* Salivary amylase begins starch breakdown.
    *   *Small Intestine:* Pancreatic amylase continues starch breakdown. Brush border enzymes (dextrinase, glucoamylase, lactase, maltase, sucrase) break down oligosaccharides and disaccharides into monosaccharides.
*   **Absorption (Small Intestine):**
    *   Glucose and galactose: Secondary active transport (co-transport with Na+) into epithelial cells.
    *   Fructose: Facilitated diffusion into epithelial cells.
    *   All monosaccharides exit basolateral membrane via facilitated diffusion into capillaries.

## Protein Digestion and Absorption:

*   **Molecules:** Proteins broken down into amino acids, dipeptides, tripeptides (absorbable forms).
*   **Digestion:**
    *   *Stomach:* Pepsin (activated from pepsinogen by HCl) begins protein breakdown into smaller polypeptides.
    *   *Small Intestine:* Pancreatic proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase - secreted as zymogens, activated by enteropeptidase and trypsin) break polypeptides into smaller peptides. Brush border enzymes (aminopeptidases, dipeptidases) break peptides into amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides.
*   **Absorption (Small Intestine):**
    *   Amino acids: Secondary active transport (co-transport with Na+) into epithelial cells.
    *   Dipeptides and tripeptides: Secondary active transport (co-transport with H+) into epithelial cells; hydrolyzed to amino acids within cells.
    *   Amino acids exit basolateral membrane via facilitated diffusion into capillaries.

## Lipid Digestion and Absorption:

*   **Molecules:** Primarily triglycerides (absorbable forms: monoglycerides and fatty acids).
*   **Digestion (Small Intestine):**
    *   *Emulsification:* Bile salts (from liver/gallbladder) break large fat globules into smaller droplets, increasing surface area for enzymes.
    *   *Enzymatic Digestion:* Pancreatic lipase breaks down triglycerides into monoglycerides and free fatty acids.
*   **Absorption (Small Intestine):**
    *   Monoglycerides and fatty acids associate with bile salts and lecithin to form **micelles**.
    *   Micelles ferry lipids to the surface of epithelial cells.
    *   Lipids diffuse from micelles into epithelial cells (simple diffusion).
    *   Inside cells, lipids are re-esterified into triglycerides.
    *   Triglycerides combine with proteins to form **chylomicrons**.
    *   Chylomicrons exit basolateral membrane via exocytosis into **lacteals** (lymphatic capillaries), bypassing the liver initially.

## Nucleic Acid Digestion and Absorption:

*   **Molecules:** DNA and RNA broken down into pentose sugars, nitrogenous bases, and phosphate ions (absorbable forms).
*   **Digestion (Small Intestine):**
    *   Pancreatic nucleases (deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease) break nucleic acids into nucleotides.
    *   Brush border enzymes (nucleosidases, phosphatases) break nucleotides into free bases, pentose sugars, and phosphate ions.
*   **Absorption (Small Intestine):** Active transport into epithelial cells, then into capillaries.

## Absorption of Vitamins, Electrolytes, and Water:

*   **Vitamins:**
    *   *Fat-soluble (A, D, E, K):* Absorbed along with lipids in micelles.
    *   *Water-soluble (B, C):* Absorbed by diffusion or active/passive transport. Vitamin B12 requires intrinsic factor (from stomach) for absorption in the ileum.
*   **Electrolytes:** Absorbed mostly along the small intestine via diffusion and active transport (e.g., Na+ coupled to glucose/amino acids, Ca2+ regulated by Vitamin D and PTH).
*   **Water:** ~9 L enter GI tract daily; ~95% absorbed, mostly in the small intestine, by osmosis following solute absorption (especially Na+). Remaining water absorbed in the large intestine.

## Check Your Understanding

1.  Where does carbohydrate digestion begin, and what enzyme is involved? What are the final absorbable products of carbohydrate digestion?
2.  Describe the key steps in protein digestion, naming at least one enzyme active in the stomach and one in the small intestine.
3.  Explain the role of bile salts and pancreatic lipase in lipid digestion.
4.  How are lipids absorbed into the small intestinal epithelial cells and then transported into the lymphatic system?
5.  How are nucleic acids digested and absorbed?

Chemical digestion reduces complex food molecules to simple monomers via specific enzymes, and absorption transports these monomers, along with vitamins, minerals, and water, across the intestinal epithelium into blood or lymph.

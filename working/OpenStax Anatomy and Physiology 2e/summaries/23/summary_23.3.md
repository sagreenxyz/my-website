# Summary: 23.3 The Mouth, Pharynx, and Esophagus

This section covers the initial structures of the digestive tract involved in ingestion, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion (initiation), propulsion, and protection.

## The Mouth (Oral Cavity / Buccal Cavity):

*   **Boundaries:** Lips (anteriorly), cheeks (laterally), palate (superiorly), tongue (inferiorly), oropharynx (posteriorly). Lined with stratified squamous epithelium (resists abrasion).
*   **Structures:**
    *   **Lips and Cheeks:** Keep food between teeth during chewing; role in speech.
    *   **Palate:**
        *   *Hard Palate:* Anterior portion, bone (palatine processes of maxillae, palatine bones). Provides rigid surface for tongue during chewing.
        *   *Soft Palate:* Posterior portion, mobile fold mostly of skeletal muscle. Closes off nasopharynx during swallowing. **Uvula** projects downward from free edge.
    *   **Tongue:** Interlacing bundles of skeletal muscle. Grips and repositions food, mixes food with saliva (forms bolus), initiates swallowing, speech, taste. Papillae on surface house taste buds. Attached by lingual frenulum.
    *   **Salivary Glands:** Produce saliva.
        *   *Major (Extrinsic) Glands:* Parotid, Submandibular, Sublingual. Lie outside oral cavity, secrete saliva via ducts.
        *   *Minor (Intrinsic) Glands:* Scattered throughout oral mucosa.
    *   **Saliva Composition:** ~97-99.5% water. Also contains electrolytes, salivary amylase (begins carbohydrate digestion), lingual lipase (begins fat digestion, activated in stomach), mucin (forms mucus), lysozyme & IgA (antibacterial). pH 6.75-7.00.
    *   **Salivation Control:** Primarily parasympathetic stimulation increases secretion. Sympathetic stimulation causes release of thick, mucin-rich saliva. ~1-1.5 L produced daily.
    *   **Teeth:** Involved in mastication (chewing). Deciduous (baby) teeth (20), Permanent teeth (32). Types: Incisors (cutting), Canines (tearing), Premolars & Molars (grinding). Structure: Crown (exposed), Root (embedded). Composed of enamel (hardest substance), dentin, pulp cavity (connective tissue, vessels, nerves).

## The Pharynx:

*   **Function:** Passageway for food (to esophagus) and air (to larynx).
*   **Regions:** Nasopharynx (air only), Oropharynx, Laryngopharynx (both food and air).
*   **Histology:** Stratified squamous epithelium (protection). Muscular wall (skeletal muscle) propels food via peristalsis during swallowing.

## The Esophagus:

*   **Function:** Muscular tube (~25 cm) that propels food from the laryngopharynx to the stomach via peristalsis. Collapsed when empty.
*   **Location:** Posterior to trachea, passes through mediastinum and diaphragm (esophageal hiatus). Joins stomach at cardial orifice, surrounded by gastroesophageal (cardiac) sphincter (physiological sphincter, prevents reflux).
*   **Histology:**
    *   *Mucosa:* Nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium (changes to simple columnar at stomach junction).
    *   *Submucosa:* Contains mucus-secreting esophageal glands.
    *   *Muscularis Externa:* Skeletal muscle superiorly, mixed in middle, smooth muscle inferiorly.
    *   *Adventitia:* Fibrous connective tissue (instead of serosa).

## Deglutition (Swallowing):

*   **Process:** Complex process involving tongue, soft palate, pharynx, esophagus. Coordinated by swallowing center in brain stem.
*   **Phases:**
    1.  **Buccal Phase (Voluntary):** Tongue pushes bolus into oropharynx.
    2.  **Pharyngeal-Esophageal Phase (Involuntary):** Triggered by bolus stimulating receptors in oropharynx. Soft palate blocks nasopharynx; epiglottis blocks larynx; pharyngeal muscles contract, propelling bolus into esophagus; upper esophageal sphincter relaxes then contracts. Peristalsis moves bolus down esophagus; gastroesophageal sphincter relaxes to allow entry into stomach.

The mouth initiates mechanical (chewing) and chemical (salivary amylase, lingual lipase) digestion and forms the bolus. The pharynx and esophagus primarily serve to propel the bolus towards the stomach via swallowing and peristalsis.

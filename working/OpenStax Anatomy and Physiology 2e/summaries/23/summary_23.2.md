# Summary: 23.2 Digestive System Processes and Regulation

This section outlines the six fundamental activities of the digestive system and the mechanisms that control these processes, including neural and hormonal regulation.

## Six Essential Digestive Processes:

1.  **Ingestion:** Taking food into the digestive tract (eating).
2.  **Propulsion:** Moving food through the alimentary canal. Includes:
    *   **Swallowing (Deglutition):** Voluntary initiation, then involuntary.
    *   **Peristalsis:** Major means of propulsion involving waves of contraction and relaxation of muscles in the organ walls (esophagus, stomach, intestines). Moves food distally.
3.  **Mechanical Breakdown:** Physically preparing food for chemical digestion. Includes:
    *   **Chewing (Mastication):** In the mouth.
    *   **Mixing:** By tongue, stomach churning, segmentation in small intestine.
    *   Increases surface area for enzymatic action.
4.  **Digestion (Chemical Breakdown):** Catabolic process where complex food molecules are broken down into their chemical building blocks (monomers) by enzymes. Begins in mouth, completed in small intestine.
5.  **Absorption:** Passage of digested end products (plus vitamins, minerals, water) from the lumen of the GI tract through the mucosal cells into the blood or lymph. Primarily occurs in the small intestine.
6.  **Defecation:** Elimination of indigestible substances from the body via the anus in the form of feces.

## Regulation of Digestive Activity:

*   **Control Mechanisms:** Digestive activity is provoked by mechanical (stretch) and chemical (osmolarity, pH, specific substrates) stimuli within the GI lumen. Receptors (mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors) detect these stimuli.
*   **Effectors:** Smooth muscle (for motility) and glands (for secretion).
*   **Regulatory Pathways:**
    1.  **Intrinsic Controls (Short Reflexes):** Mediated entirely within the **Enteric Nervous System (ENS)** - the "gut brain".
        *   ENS consists of nerve plexuses within the GI wall (Submucosal and Myenteric plexuses).
        *   Responds to stimuli within the GI tract locally, controlling segmentation, peristalsis, and secretion over short distances. Independent of CNS but influenced by it.
    2.  **Extrinsic Controls (Long Reflexes):** Involve the Central Nervous System (CNS) and autonomic nerves (parasympathetic and sympathetic).
        *   Receive input from stimuli inside or outside the GI tract (e.g., sight/smell of food).
        *   **Parasympathetic (Vagus nerve):** Generally enhances digestive activity (secretion and motility).
        *   **Sympathetic:** Generally inhibits digestive activity.
    3.  **Hormonal Controls:** Endocrine cells scattered in the stomach and small intestine mucosa release hormones into the bloodstream.
        *   Hormones travel to target organs within the digestive system (or sometimes other systems) to affect secretion or contraction (e.g., Gastrin, Secretin, Cholecystokinin (CCK)).

These regulatory mechanisms work together to ensure coordinated control of digestive processes, optimizing the breakdown and absorption of food according to the body's needs.

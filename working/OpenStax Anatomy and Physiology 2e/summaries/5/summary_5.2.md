# Summary: 5.2 Accessory Structures of the Skin

This section describes the structures derived from the epidermis that extend down into the dermis: hair, nails, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands.

*   **Hair (Pili):**
    *   **Structure:** Flexible strands produced by hair follicles, consisting largely of dead, keratinized cells.
        *   **Shaft:** Portion projecting above the skin surface.
        *   **Root:** Portion embedded within the skin (in the follicle).
        *   **Layers:** Medulla (central core), Cortex (surrounds medulla), Cuticle (outermost layer).
    *   **Hair Follicle:** Structure extending from the epidermal surface into the dermis, containing the hair root.
        *   **Hair Bulb:** Expanded deep end of the follicle.
        *   **Hair Matrix:** Actively dividing cells in the hair bulb that produce the hair.
        *   **Hair Papilla:** Dermal tissue protrusion into the hair bulb, containing capillaries that supply nutrients.
    *   **Arrector Pili Muscle:** Smooth muscle attached to the follicle; contraction causes hair to stand on end ("goosebumps").
    *   **Function:** Sensory detection (via root hair plexus), protection (scalp from sun/heat loss, nose/ears from particles), insulation (minor in humans).
    *   **Growth Cycle:** Anagen (active growth), Catagen (transition), Telogen (resting).
    *   **Hair Color:** Determined by type and amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the hair matrix.
*   **Nails:**
    *   **Structure:** Scale-like modification of the epidermis on the distal, dorsal surface of fingers and toes. Consist of hard keratin.
        *   **Nail Plate (Body):** Visible attached portion.
        *   **Free Edge:** Distal portion overhanging the fingertip.
        *   **Nail Root:** Proximal portion embedded under the skin.
        *   **Nail Bed:** Epidermis underlying the nail plate.
        *   **Nail Matrix:** Thickened proximal portion of the nail bed responsible for nail growth.
        *   **Lunula:** White, crescent-shaped region at the base of the nail (visible part of matrix).
        *   **Nail Folds:** Skin folds overlapping the nail borders.
        *   **Cuticle (Eponychium):** Proximal nail fold projecting onto the nail body.
    *   **Function:** Protect the distal ends of digits, support fingertips, aid in grasping small objects.
*   **Sweat Glands (Sudoriferous Glands):** Distributed over the entire skin surface except nipples and parts of external genitalia. Two main types:
    *   **Eccrine (Merocrine) Sweat Glands:**
        *   Most numerous type, abundant on palms, soles, forehead.
        *   Simple coiled tubular glands opening directly onto skin surface via pores.
        *   Secrete sweat (99% water, salts, vitamin C, antibodies, metabolic wastes, dermcidin).
        *   Major role in thermoregulation (evaporative cooling).
    *   **Apocrine Sweat Glands:**
        *   Larger than eccrine glands; found mainly in axillary and anogenital areas.
        *   Ducts empty into hair follicles.
        *   Secretion is similar to true sweat but also contains fatty substances and proteins (viscous, milky/yellowish). Odorless until decomposed by bacteria on skin.
        *   Begin functioning at puberty under hormonal influence; role uncertain (possibly sexual scent glands).
        *   Includes modified types: Ceruminous glands (earwax) and Mammary glands (milk).
*   **Sebaceous (Oil) Glands:**
    *   Simple branched alveolar glands found all over the body except thick skin of palms and soles.
    *   Most develop from hair follicles and secrete into the follicle.
    *   Secrete an oily substance called **sebum** via holocrine secretion (cell ruptures).
    *   **Sebum:** Softens and lubricates hair and skin, prevents water loss, has bactericidal properties.
    *   Activated at puberty by hormones. Blockage leads to acne.

These accessory structures are integral to the skin's overall functions, including protection, sensation, and thermoregulation.

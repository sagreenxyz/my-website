# Summary: 5.4 Diseases, Disorders, and Injuries of the Integumentary System

This section discusses common conditions affecting the skin, including cancers, infections, allergic reactions, burns, and effects of aging.

*   **Skin Cancer:** Uncontrolled growth of skin cells, often due to UV radiation exposure.
    *   **Basal Cell Carcinoma:** Most common type; arises from basal cells in the stratum basale; rarely metastasizes. Appears as a shiny bump, nodule, or flat scar-like area.
    *   **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** Arises from keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum; can metastasize if not treated. Appears as a firm red nodule, scaly flat lesion, or sore that doesn't heal.
    *   **Melanoma:** Most dangerous type; arises from melanocytes; highly metastatic. Often develops from a mole. Use ABCDE rule for detection (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter > 6mm, Evolving).
*   **Skin Infections and Allergies:**
    *   **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis):** Allergic reaction presenting as dry, itchy patches; may swell, flake, or bleed. Common in children.
    *   **Acne:** Clogging of pores leading to inflammation and infection, often associated with hormonal changes. Affects areas rich in sebaceous glands (face, back).
    *   **Fungal Infections:** Tinea (athlete's foot, ringworm, jock itch).
    *   **Bacterial Infections:** Impetigo, cellulitis.
    *   **Viral Infections:** Warts, herpes simplex.
*   **Burns:** Tissue damage caused by heat, radiation, electricity, or chemicals. Classified by depth:
    *   **First-degree Burn:** Superficial; affects only the epidermis (e.g., mild sunburn). Symptoms: redness, pain. Heals in days.
    *   **Second-degree Burn:** Affects epidermis and part of the dermis. Symptoms: redness, pain, blistering. Heals in weeks, may scar.
    *   **Third-degree Burn:** Full-thickness; destroys epidermis and dermis, extending into subcutaneous tissue. Appears white, red, or black; nerve endings destroyed (less painful initially). Requires skin grafting for healing.
    *   **Fourth-degree Burn:** Extends into underlying muscle and bone.
    *   **Rule of Nines:** Used to estimate the percentage of total body surface area affected by burns in adults, crucial for guiding fluid replacement and treatment decisions. Severe burns lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and risk of infection.
*   **Injuries:**
    *   **Scars:** Collagen-rich tissue formed after wound healing; differs from normal skin structure (fewer accessory structures).
    *   **Keloids:** Overgrowth of scar tissue beyond the original wound boundaries.
    *   **Bedsores (Decubitus Ulcers):** Caused by prolonged pressure on bony prominences, restricting blood flow and causing tissue necrosis.
    *   **Stretch Marks (Striae):** Result from rapid stretching of the dermis (e.g., pregnancy, weight gain), tearing collagen fibers.
*   **Effects of Aging:**
    *   Decreased cell division, metabolic activity, blood circulation.
    *   Thinner epidermis and dermis; reduced elasticity and collagen.
    *   Wrinkling, slower wound healing.
    *   Reduced melanocyte and dendritic cell activity (paler skin, lower immunity).
    *   Reduced sweat and sebum production (dry skin, difficulty regulating temperature).
    *   Thinning hair, graying hair.

Understanding these common skin pathologies is important for prevention, early detection, and treatment.

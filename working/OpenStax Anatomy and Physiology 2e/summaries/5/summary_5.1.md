# Summary: 5.1 Layers of the Skin

This section describes the structure of the skin, which consists of two main layers, the epidermis and the dermis, overlying the hypodermis.

*   **Integumentary System:** Consists of the skin (cutaneous membrane) and its accessory structures (hair, nails, glands).
*   **Skin:** The largest organ of the body.
*   **Epidermis:**
    *   Outermost layer; composed of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.
    *   Avascular (lacks blood vessels).
    *   Consists of four or five distinct layers (strata), depending on location:
        *   **Stratum Basale (Stratum Germinativum):** Deepest layer; single row of actively mitotic stem cells (keratinocytes) that produce new cells. Also contains melanocytes (produce melanin pigment) and Merkel cells (touch receptors). Attached to the dermis.
        *   **Stratum Spinosum:** Several layers thick; cells contain pre-keratin filaments attached to desmosomes, giving them a "spiny" appearance in prepared slides. Contains Langerhans' (dendritic) cells (immune function).
        *   **Stratum Granulosum:** 3-5 layers of flattened keratinocytes; organelles deteriorating. Cytoplasm contains keratohyaline granules (help form keratin) and lamellar granules (contain water-resistant glycolipids). Last layer with living cells.
        *   **Stratum Lucidum:** Thin, translucent band visible only in **thick skin** (palms, soles). Consists of a few rows of flat, dead keratinocytes.
        *   **Stratum Corneum:** Outermost layer; 20-30 cell layers thick. Consists of anucleated, keratinized dead cells (cornified cells). Provides a durable protective barrier against abrasion, penetration, and water loss.
    *   **Cells of the Epidermis:**
        *   **Keratinocytes:** Produce keratin (fibrous protein); most abundant cell type.
        *   **Melanocytes:** Produce melanin; protect against UV damage.
        *   **Dendritic (Langerhans') Cells:** Macrophages; key activators of the immune system.
        *   **Tactile (Merkel) Cells:** Sensory receptors for touch.
*   **Dermis:**
    *   Layer deep to the epidermis; composed mainly of dense irregular connective tissue.
    *   Strong, flexible connective tissue layer containing collagen and elastic fibers.
    *   Vascularized and innervated. Contains hair follicles, oil glands, and sweat glands.
    *   Two layers:
        *   **Papillary Layer:** Superficial layer (about 20% of dermis); areolar connective tissue. Contains dermal papillae (projections indenting the epidermis) which house capillaries, free nerve endings, and Meissner's corpuscles (touch receptors). In thick skin, papillae lie atop dermal ridges, forming epidermal ridges (fingerprints).
        *   **Reticular Layer:** Deeper layer (about 80% of dermis); dense irregular connective tissue. Contains thick bundles of collagen fibers (providing strength) and elastic fibers (providing stretch-recoil). Contains blood vessels, glands, hair follicles, Pacinian corpuscles (pressure receptors). Cleavage lines (tension lines) and flexure lines are found here.
*   **Hypodermis (Superficial Fascia):**
    *   Layer deep to the dermis; **not** considered part of the skin.
    *   Composed primarily of adipose tissue and areolar connective tissue.
    *   Anchors the skin to underlying structures (mostly muscles), allows skin to slide, acts as a shock absorber and insulator, stores fat.
*   **Skin Color:** Determined by three pigments:
    *   **Melanin:** Primary pigment (yellow to reddish-brown to black); produced by melanocytes, amount influenced by genetics and sun exposure. Protects against UV radiation.
    *   **Carotene:** Yellow to orange pigment found in certain plants; accumulates in stratum corneum and hypodermis.
    *   **Hemoglobin:** Pinkish hue of fair skin reflects the crimson color of oxygenated hemoglobin in dermal capillaries.

The skin is a complex organ with distinct layers, each contributing to its overall function in protecting the body.

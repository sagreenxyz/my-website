# Summary: 5.3 Functions of the Integumentary System

This section details the diverse physiological roles performed by the skin and its accessory structures.

*   **Protection:** Acts as a physical, chemical, and biological barrier.
    *   **Physical Barrier:** Protects against mechanical injury (abrasion), water loss (keratin and glycolipids), and UV radiation (melanin).
    *   **Chemical Barrier:** Acid mantle (low pH of skin secretions) inhibits bacterial growth. Sebum contains bactericidal substances.
    *   **Biological Barrier:** Dendritic (Langerhans) cells in the epidermis and macrophages in the dermis activate the immune system.
*   **Sensory Reception:** Contains various sensory receptors (nerve endings) that detect stimuli from the external environment.
    *   **Tactile (Meissner's) Corpuscles & Merkel Cells:** Detect light touch.
    *   **Lamellated (Pacinian) Corpuscles:** Detect deep pressure and vibration.
    *   **Free Nerve Endings:** Detect pain, temperature, and touch.
    *   **Hair Follicle Receptors:** Detect hair movement.
*   **Thermoregulation:** Helps maintain stable internal body temperature through:
    *   **Sweating:** Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface cools the body (regulated by sympathetic nervous system). Eccrine sweat glands are key.
    *   **Blood Flow Regulation:** Dermal blood vessels constrict (vasoconstriction) in cold environments to conserve heat and dilate (vasodilation) in hot environments to release heat.
*   **Metabolic Functions:**
    *   **Vitamin D Synthesis:** Skin synthesizes inactive Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) when exposed to UV radiation. This precursor is then modified by the liver and kidneys into active Vitamin D (calcitriol), essential for calcium absorption.
    *   **Other minor metabolic roles:** e.g., activation of some steroid hormones.
*   **Blood Reservoir:** The extensive network of dermal blood vessels can hold a significant portion (up to 5%) of the body's total blood volume. This blood can be shunted to other organs when needed.
*   **Excretion:** Limited excretion of nitrogenous wastes (ammonia, urea, uric acid), salts, and water occurs through sweat.

The integumentary system performs a multitude of functions vital for survival and interaction with the environment.

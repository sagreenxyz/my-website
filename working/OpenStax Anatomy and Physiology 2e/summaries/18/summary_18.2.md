# Summary: 18.2 Production of the Formed Elements

This section details the process of hematopoiesis, the formation of blood's formed elements.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Hematopoiesis:** The process by which formed elements of blood develop, occurring primarily in the red bone marrow after birth.
*   **Hemocytoblast:** The hematopoietic stem cell from which all formed elements originate.
*   **Differentiation Pathways:** Hemocytoblasts differentiate into two main lineages:
    *   **Myeloid Stem Cells:** Give rise to erythrocytes, megakaryocytes (producing platelets), mast cells, and myeloblast lineage (granulocytes: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils; and monocytes).
    *   **Lymphoid Stem Cells:** Give rise to lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, NK cells).
*   **Hematopoietic Growth Factors:** Hormones and growth factors regulate the differentiation and proliferation of specific formed elements. Examples include Erythropoietin (EPO) for erythrocytes, thrombopoietin for platelets, and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) and interleukins for leukocytes.

Hematopoiesis is a continuous, regulated process ensuring the body maintains adequate levels of all blood cell types.

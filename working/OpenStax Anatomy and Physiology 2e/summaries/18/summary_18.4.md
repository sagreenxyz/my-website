# Summary: 18.4 Leukocytes and Platelets

This section describes leukocytes (White Blood Cells) and platelets, their types, functions, and related disorders.

## Leukocytes (WBCs):

*   **Function:** Defend the body against pathogens and disease. Unlike RBCs, they are complete cells with nuclei and organelles and function primarily outside the bloodstream in tissues.
*   **Characteristics:** Exhibit emigration (diapedesis) to leave capillaries and positive chemotaxis to move toward chemical signals of injury/infection.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Granulocytes (contain visible granules):**
        *   *Neutrophils:* Most numerous; phagocytic, especially against bacteria.
        *   *Eosinophils:* Combat parasitic worms; involved in allergic reactions.
        *   *Basophils:* Release histamine and heparin; involved in inflammatory and allergic responses.
    *   **Agranulocytes (lack visible granules):**
        *   *Lymphocytes:* Crucial for specific immunity (T cells, B cells, NK cells).
        *   *Monocytes:* Differentiate into macrophages; powerful phagocytes.
*   **Disorders:** Leukopenia (low WBC count), Leukocytosis (high WBC count), Leukemia (cancer involving abundant nonfunctional WBCs), Lymphoma (cancer of lymphocytes accumulating in lymphoid tissues).

## Platelets (Thrombocytes):

*   **Structure & Origin:** Cell fragments derived from large megakaryocytes in red bone marrow.
*   **Function:** Essential for hemostasis (blood clotting); form platelet plugs and release factors that promote coagulation.
*   **Regulation:** Production stimulated by thrombopoietin.
*   **Disorders:** Thrombocytosis (excess platelets), Thrombocytopenia (insufficient platelets, risk of bleeding).

Leukocytes provide immunity, while platelets are critical for preventing blood loss.

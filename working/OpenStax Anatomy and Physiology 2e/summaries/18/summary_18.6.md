# Summary: 18.6 Blood Typing

This section covers the basis of blood typing, focusing on the ABO and Rh blood groups.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Antigens (Agglutinogens):** Genetically determined glycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of erythrocytes. Determine an individual's blood type.
*   **Antibodies (Agglutinins):** Proteins found in the plasma that recognize and bind to specific antigens not present on the individual's own RBCs.
*   **Agglutination:** Clumping of RBCs that occurs when antibodies in the recipient's plasma bind to antigens on donated RBCs. This can block blood flow and lead to hemolysis (RBC destruction).
*   **ABO Blood Group:**
    *   Based on the presence or absence of A and B antigens.
    *   **Type A:** Has A antigens, anti-B antibodies.
    *   **Type B:** Has B antigens, anti-A antibodies.
    *   **Type AB:** Has both A and B antigens, no anti-A or anti-B antibodies (universal recipient).
    *   **Type O:** Has neither A nor B antigens, both anti-A and anti-B antibodies (universal donor).
    *   Antibodies (IgM) develop spontaneously shortly after birth.
*   **Rh Blood Group:**
    *   Based on the presence or absence of the Rh D antigen (also called Rh factor).
    *   **Rh-positive (Rh+):** Has the D antigen.
    *   **Rh-negative (Rh-):** Lacks the D antigen.
    *   Anti-Rh antibodies (IgG) are not pre-formed; they develop only after an Rh-negative individual is exposed to Rh+ blood (e.g., transfusion, pregnancy).
*   **Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN):** Can occur when an Rh-negative mother carries an Rh-positive fetus. Maternal anti-Rh antibodies can cross the placenta and attack fetal RBCs. Preventable with RhoGAM injections.
*   **Blood Typing and Cross-Matching:** Procedures performed before transfusions to ensure compatibility between donor and recipient blood, preventing transfusion reactions.

Understanding ABO and Rh blood groups is critical for safe blood transfusions and managing pregnancy-related incompatibilities.

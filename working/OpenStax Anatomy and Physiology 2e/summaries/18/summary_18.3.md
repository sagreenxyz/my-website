# Summary: 18.3 Erythrocytes

This section focuses on erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells), their structure, function, lifecycle, and related disorders.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Structure & Function:** Erythrocytes (RBCs) are biconcave discs lacking a nucleus and most organelles, maximizing space for hemoglobin and facilitating gas transport (primarily oxygen, some carbon dioxide). Their shape increases surface area and allows flexibility.
*   **Hemoglobin:** A protein containing iron that binds oxygen. Each RBC contains millions of hemoglobin molecules. Oxygen binding is reversible and depends on partial pressure.
*   **Erythropoiesis:** RBC production, stimulated by erythropoietin (EPO) released from the kidneys in response to hypoxia. Requires iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid.
*   **Lifecycle:** RBCs circulate for about 120 days before being phagocytized by macrophages, primarily in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Hemoglobin components are recycled (iron stored/reused, globin broken down, non-iron heme portion degraded to bilirubin and excreted).
*   **Disorders:**
    *   **Anemia:** Reduced oxygen-carrying capacity due to low RBC count or low hemoglobin (e.g., iron-deficiency, pernicious, sickle cell anemia).
    *   **Polycythemia:** Excess RBCs, increasing blood viscosity.

Erythrocytes are specialized cells crucial for oxygen delivery throughout the body.

# Summary: 25.9 Regulation of Fluid Volume and Composition

This section details the mechanisms by which the body, primarily through kidney function, regulates the volume and composition of its fluids, focusing on water and key electrolytes.

## Water Balance:

*   **Intake:** Primarily through liquids, food, and metabolic water production. Regulated by the thirst mechanism (stimulated by increased plasma osmolarity, detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus).
*   **Output:** Urine (major regulated route), feces, sweat, insensible loss (skin evaporation, lungs).
*   **Regulation:** Primarily via Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) released from the posterior pituitary.
    *   High plasma osmolarity or low blood volume/pressure stimulates ADH release.
    *   ADH increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts by promoting aquaporin insertion.
    *   Leads to concentrated urine and reduced water loss.
    *   Low osmolarity inhibits ADH, leading to dilute urine.

## Electrolyte Balance (Examples):

*   **Sodium (Na+):** Major extracellular cation; crucial for fluid balance, nerve/muscle function.
    *   **Regulation:** Primarily via Aldosterone (from adrenal cortex).
        *   Stimulated by angiotensin II (via renin release due to low BP/Na+) or high K+.
        *   Increases Na+ reabsorption (and K+ secretion) in the DCT and collecting ducts.
    *   Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP): Released by heart atria due to high BP/volume; inhibits Na+ reabsorption (and renin/aldosterone release), promoting Na+ and water excretion.
*   **Potassium (K+):** Major intracellular cation; vital for resting membrane potential, nerve/muscle function.
    *   **Regulation:** Primarily via Aldosterone, which promotes K+ secretion into the filtrate in the DCT and collecting ducts. Renal tubules can also reabsorb K+ if levels are low.
*   **Calcium (Ca2+) and Phosphate (PO43-):** Regulated mainly by Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) and Calcitriol (active Vitamin D).
    *   PTH increases Ca2+ reabsorption and decreases PO43- reabsorption in the kidneys.
    *   Calcitriol enhances Ca2+ absorption in the intestine.

## Acid-Base Balance:

*   Kidneys contribute by excreting H+ and conserving/generating bicarbonate (HCO3-). (Detailed in other sections).

Precise regulation of water and electrolytes by hormonal and neural mechanisms acting on the kidneys is essential for maintaining fluid volume, osmolarity, and cellular function.

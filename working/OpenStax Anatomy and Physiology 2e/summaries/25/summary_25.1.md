# Summary: 25.1 Physical Characteristics of Urine

This section describes the typical physical properties and chemical composition of urine, highlighting how they reflect metabolic activity and overall health.

## Physical Characteristics:

*   **Color and Transparency:**
    *   **Normal:** Clear, pale yellow to deep amber. Color due to **urochrome**, a pigment derived from hemoglobin breakdown. Deeper color indicates more concentrated urine.
    *   **Abnormal Colors:** Pink/brown (blood, certain foods/drugs), cloudy (infection, contaminants).
    *   **Transparency:** Should be clear; becomes cloudy upon standing due to solute precipitation. Persistent cloudiness may indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI).
*   **Odor:**
    *   **Normal:** Slightly aromatic. Develops ammonia odor upon standing due to bacterial action on urea.
    *   **Abnormal Odors:** Fruity (ketones in diabetes), specific odors related to certain foods (e.g., asparagus) or diseases.
*   **pH:**
    *   **Range:** Typically slightly acidic (~pH 6), but ranges from 4.5 to 8.0.
    *   **Influences:** Diet (acidic with high protein/whole wheat; alkaline with vegetarian diet), prolonged vomiting, UTIs (can raise pH).
*   **Specific Gravity:**
    *   **Definition:** Ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of distilled water. Measures solute concentration.
    *   **Range:** 1.001 to 1.035.
    *   **Interpretation:** Higher specific gravity indicates more concentrated urine (fewer solutes or dehydration); lower specific gravity indicates dilute urine (overhydration, kidney disease).

## Chemical Composition:

*   **Water:** Accounts for ~95% of urine volume.
*   **Solutes (Normal):**
    *   **Nitrogenous Wastes:**
        *   **Urea:** Most abundant solute; derived from amino acid breakdown.
        *   **Uric Acid:** End product of nucleic acid metabolism.
        *   **Creatinine:** Metabolite of creatine phosphate from muscle tissue.
    *   **Ions (Electrolytes):** Sodium (Na+), Potassium (K+), Phosphate (PO43-), Sulfate (SO42-), Chloride (Cl-), Calcium (Ca2+), Magnesium (Mg2+). Concentrations vary with diet and hydration.
    *   Other substances like bicarbonate (HCO3-), urobilinogen.
*   **Abnormal Solutes (Indicative of Pathology):**
    *   **Glucose (Glycosuria):** Often indicates diabetes mellitus.
    *   **Proteins (Proteinuria/Albuminuria):** Usually indicates glomerular damage (increased permeability).
    *   **Ketone Bodies (Ketonuria):** Excessive fat metabolism (starvation, untreated diabetes mellitus).
    *   **Hemoglobin (Hemoglobinuria):** Transfusion reactions, hemolytic anemia.
    *   **Bile Pigments (Bilirubinuria):** Liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis).
    *   **Erythrocytes (Hematuria):** Bleeding in the urinary tract (trauma, kidney stones, infection).
    *   **Leukocytes (Pyuria):** Urinary tract infection (UTI).

Urinalysis, the examination of urine's physical and chemical properties, is a valuable diagnostic tool providing insights into metabolic state, kidney function, and potential diseases.

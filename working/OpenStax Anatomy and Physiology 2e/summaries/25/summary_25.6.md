# Summary: 25.6 Tubular Reabsorption

This section explains the process by which the renal tubules reclaim most of the water and useful solutes from the glomerular filtrate and return them to the blood.

## Overview:

*   **Definition:** Movement of substances from the filtrate within the renal tubule lumen back into the peritubular capillary blood.
*   **Magnitude:** Huge volume; ~180 L of filtrate produced daily, but only ~1.5 L excreted as urine. >99% of filtrate is reabsorbed.
*   **Selectivity:** Reabsorption is selective. Glucose, amino acids, vitamins, and most ions are completely or largely reabsorbed. Wastes like urea, creatinine, and uric acid are less reabsorbed.
*   **Location:** Occurs along the entire length of the renal tubule (PCT, Loop of Henle, DCT, Collecting Duct), but most occurs in the Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT).

## Mechanisms of Reabsorption:

*   **Transcellular Route:** Substances pass through the apical membrane, cytosol, and basolateral membrane of the tubule cell, then through the interstitial fluid and into the capillary.
*   **Paracellular Route:** Substances pass between the tubule cells through tight junctions (limited by junction permeability, mainly water and some ions like Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+).
*   **Active Transport:** Requires ATP, moves substances against their concentration gradient (e.g., Na+ via Na+/K+ ATPase pump on basolateral membrane). Primary active transport uses ATP directly; secondary active transport uses the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport (e.g., glucose, amino acids co-transported with Na+).
*   **Passive Transport:** Diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis. Moves substances down their concentration gradient. Water follows solutes by osmosis (obligatory water reabsorption, especially following Na+).

## Reabsorption in Different Tubule Segments:

*   **Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT):** The primary site of reabsorption.
    *   Reabsorbs ~65% of filtered Na+ and water.
    *   Reabsorbs virtually 100% of glucose, amino acids, lactate, vitamins.
    *   Reabsorbs significant amounts of K+, Cl-, HCO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+.
    *   Reabsorbs ~50% of urea.
    *   Secretes H+ and some wastes.
*   **Nephron Loop (Loop of Henle):**
    *   **Descending Limb:** Permeable to water but not solutes. Water moves out by osmosis into the hypertonic medullary interstitium. Filtrate becomes more concentrated.
    *   **Ascending Limb:** Impermeable to water. Actively transports Na+, K+, Cl- out into the interstitium. Filtrate becomes more dilute. Crucial for establishing the medullary osmotic gradient.
*   **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT) and Collecting Duct:**
    *   Reabsorption is hormonally regulated ("facultative reabsorption").
    *   **Aldosterone:** Increases Na+ reabsorption (and K+ secretion). Water follows Na+.
    *   **ADH:** Increases water reabsorption by making collecting ducts permeable to water (aquaporins).
    *   **PTH:** Increases Ca2+ reabsorption in the DCT.
    *   Also involved in acid-base balance (H+ secretion, HCO3- reabsorption/generation).

## Transport Maximum (Tm):

*   For substances reabsorbed via transport proteins (e.g., glucose), there is a maximum rate of transport (Tm) when all carriers are saturated.
*   If the concentration of the substance in the filtrate exceeds the Tm, the excess is excreted in the urine (e.g., glycosuria in diabetes mellitus).

Tubular reabsorption is a vital, complex process involving multiple transport mechanisms along the nephron, reclaiming essential substances while allowing wastes to be excreted.

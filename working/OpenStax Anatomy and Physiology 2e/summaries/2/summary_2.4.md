# Summary: 2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning

This section discusses inorganic compounds—those generally lacking carbon (except CO2, bicarbonates)—that are vital for life, focusing primarily on water, salts, acids, and bases.

## Key Inorganic Compounds:

*   **Water (H2O):**
    *   Most abundant inorganic compound (~60% of body weight).
    *   **High Heat Capacity:** Absorbs and releases large amounts of heat with little temperature change; important for temperature regulation.
    *   **High Heat of Vaporization:** Large amount of heat needed to vaporize; effective cooling mechanism (sweating).
    *   **Polar Solvent Properties:** Excellent solvent for ionic and polar substances (hydrophilic); forms hydration layers around molecules. Essential for transport and chemical reactions. Nonpolar substances (hydrophobic) do not dissolve well.
    *   **Reactivity:** Participates in chemical reactions (hydrolysis and dehydration synthesis).
    *   **Cushioning:** Protects organs (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid).
*   **Salts:**
    *   Ionic compounds containing cations other than H+ and anions other than OH-.
    *   Dissociate into ions (electrolytes) in water.
    *   Ions are essential for nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, fluid balance, bone hardness (e.g., NaCl, CaCO3, KCl).
*   **Acids:**
    *   Substances that release hydrogen ions (H+, protons) in solution (proton donors).
    *   Sour taste, can react with metals.
    *   Strong acids dissociate completely (e.g., HCl); weak acids dissociate partially (e.g., H2CO3 - carbonic acid).
    *   Increase H+ concentration, lowering pH.
*   **Bases:**
    *   Substances that accept hydrogen ions (H+) or release hydroxide ions (OH-) in solution (proton acceptors).
    *   Bitter taste, feel slippery.
    *   Strong bases dissociate completely (e.g., NaOH); weak bases dissociate partially (e.g., HCO3- - bicarbonate ion).
    *   Decrease H+ concentration (by binding H+ or releasing OH-), raising pH.
*   **pH Scale:**
    *   Measures the relative concentration of H+ ions in a solution. Logarithmic scale (0-14).
    *   pH 7 = Neutral ([H+] = [OH-]).
    *   pH < 7 = Acidic ([H+] > [OH-]).
    *   pH > 7 = Basic (Alkaline) ([H+] < [OH-]).
    *   Blood pH is tightly regulated around 7.35-7.45.
*   **Buffers:**
    *   Systems that resist abrupt changes in pH by binding H+ when pH drops and releasing H+ when pH rises.
    *   Crucial for maintaining blood pH homeostasis (e.g., carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer system).

The properties of inorganic compounds, especially water, and the maintenance of pH balance are critical for physiological functions.

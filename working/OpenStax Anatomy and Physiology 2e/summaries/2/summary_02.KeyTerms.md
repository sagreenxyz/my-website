# Summary: Chapter 2 Key Terms

This section lists important terminology related to the chemical basis of life discussed in Chapter 2.

*(Note: The specific terms are derived from the HTML content. Below is a representation of the types of terms typically found.)*

*   **Acid:** Substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in solution (pH < 7).
*   **Amino Acid:** Monomer of proteins, containing an amino group and a carboxyl group.
*   **Atom:** Smallest unit of an element.
*   **ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate):** Primary energy currency of the cell.
*   **Base:** Substance that accepts hydrogen ions (H+) or releases hydroxide ions (OH-) in solution (pH > 7).
*   **Buffer:** Solution that resists changes in pH.
*   **Carbohydrate:** Organic molecule composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (e.g., sugars, starch, cellulose).
*   **Catalyst:** Substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed.
*   **Covalent Bond:** Chemical bond formed by sharing electrons.
*   **Decomposition Reaction:** Reaction breaking down a larger molecule into smaller parts (catabolism).
*   **Denaturation:** Loss of a protein's three-dimensional structure, often leading to loss of function.
*   **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):** Nucleic acid that stores genetic information.
*   **Electron:** Negatively charged subatomic particle.
*   **Element:** Pure substance composed of only one type of atom.
*   **Enzyme:** Biological catalyst, usually a protein.
*   **Hydrogen Bond:** Weak attraction between a slightly positive hydrogen atom and a slightly negative atom (often oxygen or nitrogen).
*   **Ion:** Atom or molecule with a net electrical charge.
*   **Ionic Bond:** Chemical bond formed by the attraction between oppositely charged ions.
*   **Isotope:** Variant of an element with a different number of neutrons.
*   **Lipid:** Hydrophobic organic molecule (e.g., fats, oils, phospholipids, steroids).
*   **Molecule:** Two or more atoms joined by chemical bonds.
*   **Monosaccharide:** Simple sugar, monomer of carbohydrates.
*   **Neutron:** Uncharged subatomic particle found in the nucleus.
*   **Nucleic Acid:** Organic molecule composed of nucleotides (DNA, RNA).
*   **Nucleotide:** Monomer of nucleic acids, composed of a sugar, phosphate group, and nitrogenous base.
*   **pH:** Measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution.
*   **Phospholipid:** Lipid molecule forming the basis of cell membranes.
*   **Polysaccharide:** Complex carbohydrate composed of many monosaccharides.
*   **Protein:** Organic molecule composed of amino acids, performing diverse functions.
*   **Proton:** Positively charged subatomic particle found in the nucleus.
*   **RNA (Ribonucleic Acid):** Nucleic acid involved in protein synthesis.
*   **Solute:** Substance dissolved in a solvent.
*   **Solution:** Homogeneous mixture of a solute dissolved in a solvent.
*   **Solvent:** Substance that dissolves a solute (often water in biological systems).
*   **Steroid:** Type of lipid characterized by a four-ring structure (e.g., cholesterol, hormones).
*   **Synthesis Reaction:** Reaction combining smaller molecules to form a larger one (anabolism).
*   **Triglyceride:** Lipid composed of glycerol and three fatty acids; main form of stored energy.

# Summary: Chapter 2 Introduction - The Chemical Level of Organization

This introductory section transitions from the macroscopic view of the body to its fundamental chemical building blocks. It emphasizes that all physiological processes rely on chemical reactions. The chapter will explore basic concepts of chemistry relevant to human life, including atomic structure, chemical bonding, the properties of water, acids and bases, and the structure and function of the essential organic macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids) that form the basis of life.

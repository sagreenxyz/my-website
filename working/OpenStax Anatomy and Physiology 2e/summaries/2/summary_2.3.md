# Summary: 2.3 Chemical Reactions

This section explains how chemical bonds are formed, broken, or rearranged during chemical reactions, leading to the transformation of substances. It also covers energy changes and factors influencing reaction rates.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Chemical Reaction:** Occurs when chemical bonds are formed, rearranged, or broken. Represented by chemical equations (Reactants → Products).
*   **Types of Reactions:**
    *   **Synthesis (Combination) Reaction:** Atoms or molecules combine to form a larger, more complex molecule (A + B → AB). Basis of anabolic processes.
    *   **Decomposition Reaction:** A molecule is broken down into smaller molecules or atoms (AB → A + B). Basis of catabolic processes.
    *   **Exchange (Displacement) Reaction:** Bonds are both made and broken; parts of reactants are rearranged (AB + C → AC + B or AB + CD → AD + CB).
*   **Energy Flow in Reactions:**
    *   **Exergonic Reactions:** Release energy (e.g., catabolic reactions). Products have less potential energy than reactants.
    *   **Endergonic Reactions:** Absorb or require energy input (e.g., anabolic reactions). Products have more potential energy than reactants. Energy often supplied by ATP.
*   **Reversibility:** Most chemical reactions are theoretically reversible (A + B ⇌ AB). Chemical equilibrium is reached when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal.
*   **Factors Influencing Reaction Rates:**
    *   **Temperature:** Higher temperature increases kinetic energy, leading to more frequent and forceful collisions → faster rate.
    *   **Concentration:** Higher concentration of reactants increases collision frequency → faster rate.
    *   **Particle Size:** Smaller particles move faster and collide more frequently → faster rate.
    *   **Catalysts (Enzymes):** Substances that increase reaction rates without being chemically changed themselves. Enzymes are biological catalysts that lower the **activation energy** (energy needed to start a reaction).

Chemical reactions are fundamental to all metabolic processes in the body.

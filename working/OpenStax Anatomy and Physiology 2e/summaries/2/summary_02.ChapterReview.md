# Summary: Chapter 2 Chapter Review - The Chemical Level of Organization

This chapter review consolidates the fundamental chemical principles essential for understanding human anatomy and physiology.

## Key Concepts Recapped:

*   **2.1 Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules:** Covers basic atomic structure (protons, neutrons, electrons), elements common in the body, isotopes, the formation of ions, and how atoms combine via chemical bonds (ionic, covalent, hydrogen) to form molecules and compounds.
*   **2.2 Chemical Reactions:** Explains different types of chemical reactions (synthesis/anabolism, decomposition/catabolism, exchange) and factors influencing their rates (temperature, concentration, catalysts/enzymes). Introduces the concept of chemical energy.
*   **2.3 Inorganic Compounds:** Focuses on the vital roles of water (high heat capacity, polarity/solvent properties, cushioning, reactivity) and the importance of salts, acids, and bases. Explains the pH scale and the function of buffer systems in maintaining acid-base balance.
*   **2.4 Organic Compounds:** Details the structure and function of the four major classes of organic macromolecules:
    *   **Carbohydrates:** Monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides; primary role as cellular fuel.
    *   **Lipids:** Triglycerides (energy storage), phospholipids (cell membranes), steroids (cholesterol, hormones); generally hydrophobic.
    *   **Proteins:** Polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds; four levels of structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary) determining function; roles include enzymes, structure, transport, etc.; denaturation.
    *   **Nucleic Acids:** DNA (genetic blueprint) and RNA (protein synthesis); polymers of nucleotides.
*   **2.5 ATP:** Describes adenosine triphosphate as the main energy-transfer molecule used directly by cells for work.

The chapter emphasizes how the body's structure and function are ultimately based on chemical interactions.

# Summary: 2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning

This section describes the major classes of organic compounds—those containing carbon and typically hydrogen—that are unique to living systems: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Carbon's ability to form four covalent bonds allows for large, complex molecules.

## Major Organic Compounds:

*   **Carbohydrates:** (Contain C, H, O; H:O ratio often ~2:1)
    *   **Function:** Major source of cellular fuel (glucose); structural molecules.
    *   **Monomer:** Monosaccharide (simple sugar, e.g., glucose, fructose, galactose).
    *   **Disaccharides:** Two linked monosaccharides (e.g., sucrose, lactose, maltose).
    *   **Polysaccharides:** Long chains of monosaccharides (e.g., starch - plant storage, glycogen - animal storage in liver/muscle). Formed by dehydration synthesis, broken by hydrolysis.
*   **Lipids (Fats):** (Contain C, H, O; less O than carbs; sometimes P) Insoluble in water (hydrophobic).
    *   **Triglycerides (Neutral Fats):** Glycerol + 3 fatty acids. Function: Energy storage, insulation, protection. Fatty acids can be saturated (no double bonds, solid at room temp) or unsaturated (one or more double bonds, liquid at room temp).
    *   **Phospholipids:** Modified triglycerides (Glycerol + 2 fatty acids + phosphorus-containing group). Amphipathic (hydrophilic head, hydrophobic tail). Function: Major component of cell membranes.
    *   **Steroids:** Four interlocking hydrocarbon rings (e.g., cholesterol). Function: Component of cell membranes; basis for steroid hormones (e.g., testosterone, estrogen), bile salts, vitamin D.
    *   **Eicosanoids:** Derived from fatty acids (e.g., prostaglandins). Function: Signaling molecules (inflammation, blood clotting, etc.).
*   **Proteins:** (Contain C, H, O, N; sometimes S) Polymers of amino acids.
    *   **Monomer:** Amino Acid (20 common types). Structure: Central carbon, amino group (-NH2), carboxyl group (-COOH), hydrogen atom, R group (variable side chain). Linked by peptide bonds (formed via dehydration synthesis).
    *   **Function:** Diverse roles - structural (collagen), enzymes (catalysts), transport (hemoglobin), contractile (actin/myosin), communication (hormones, receptors), defense (antibodies).
    *   **Levels of Structure:** Primary (amino acid sequence), Secondary (alpha-helix, beta-sheet; H-bonds), Tertiary (3D folding; interactions between R groups), Quaternary (arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains).
    *   **Denaturation:** Loss of 3D structure (and function) due to heat, pH changes, etc.
    *   **Enzymes:** Biological catalysts; specific, efficient, lower activation energy. Often end in "-ase".
*   **Nucleic Acids:** (Contain C, H, O, N, P) Largest molecules in the body. Polymers of nucleotides.
    *   **Monomer:** Nucleotide. Structure: Nitrogenous base (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine, Uracil), pentose sugar (deoxyribose or ribose), phosphate group.
    *   **Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA):** Double helix structure; sugar is deoxyribose; bases A, G, C, T. Function: Stores genetic information in the nucleus; replicates itself before cell division.
    *   **Ribonucleic Acid (RNA):** Single-stranded; sugar is ribose; bases A, G, C, U. Function: Carries out genetic instructions for protein synthesis (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA). Found mainly outside the nucleus.
*   **Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP):**
    *   Modified nucleotide (adenine, ribose, 3 phosphate groups).
    *   **Function:** Primary energy-transferring molecule in cells. Energy is released when the terminal high-energy phosphate bond is broken (ATP → ADP + Pi + Energy).

These four classes of organic macromolecules perform a vast array of functions essential for cellular structure and activity.

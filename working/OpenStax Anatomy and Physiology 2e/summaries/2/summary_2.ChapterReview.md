# Summary: Chapter 2 Chapter Review - The Chemical Level of Organization

This chapter review summarizes the fundamental chemical principles that underpin human anatomy and physiology.

## Key Concepts Recapped:

*   **2.1 Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules:** Defines elements and atoms (protons, neutrons, electrons). Explains isotopes and their applications. Discusses ions (cations, anions) and the formation of molecules and compounds through chemical bonds.
*   **2.2 Chemical Bonds:** Describes the main types of bonds holding atoms together:
    *   **Ionic Bonds:** Transfer of electrons, forming ions attracted to each other.
    *   **Covalent Bonds:** Sharing of electrons (nonpolar: equal sharing; polar: unequal sharing, creating partial charges).
    *   **Hydrogen Bonds:** Weak attractions involving a hydrogen atom bonded to an electronegative atom (like O or N). Important for water properties and macromolecule structure.
*   **2.3 Chemical Reactions:** Explains how chemical bonds are formed and broken. Covers types of reactions (synthesis/anabolism, decomposition/catabolism, exchange) and the concept of chemical energy. Discusses factors influencing reaction rates (concentration, temperature, catalysts/enzymes).
*   **2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to Life:** Focuses on water, salts, acids, and bases.
    *   **Water:** Its polarity, solvent properties, high heat capacity/vaporization, cohesion/adhesion, and role in reactions are crucial for life.
    *   **Salts:** Ionic compounds that dissociate in water.
    *   **Acids & Bases:** Defined by H+ release/acceptance. Introduces the pH scale (0-14) and the importance of buffers in maintaining pH homeostasis.
*   **2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Life:** Introduces carbon's unique bonding properties and the four major classes of organic macromolecules built from smaller monomers:
    *   **Carbohydrates:** (CH2O)n; Monosaccharides (glucose), disaccharides (sucrose), polysaccharides (starch, glycogen, cellulose). Primary energy source.
    *   **Lipids:** Hydrophobic; includes triglycerides (energy storage), phospholipids (cell membranes), steroids (cholesterol, hormones), and eicosanoids.
    *   **Proteins:** Polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Diverse functions (structure, enzymes, transport, defense). Discusses the four levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary) and denaturation. Highlights enzyme function as biological catalysts.
    *   **Nucleic Acids:** DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). Polymers of nucleotides (sugar, phosphate, base). DNA stores genetic code; RNA involved in protein synthesis. Introduces ATP (adenosine triphosphate) as the cell's main energy currency.

Understanding these chemical building blocks and reactions is essential for comprehending biological processes.

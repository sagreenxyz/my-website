# Summary: 28.4 Changes During Pregnancy, Labor, and Birth

This section details the significant physiological adjustments the mother's body undergoes during pregnancy to support the developing fetus, as well as the process of labor (parturition) and birth.

## Maternal Changes During Pregnancy:

*   **Anatomical:**
    *   Uterus enlarges significantly, displacing abdominal organs.
    *   Rib cage widens, lordosis (lumbar curvature) increases.
    *   Weight gain (fetus, placenta, amniotic fluid, increased blood volume, fat stores).
    *   Breast enlargement.
*   **Physiological:**
    *   **Cardiovascular:** Blood volume increases (~40%), cardiac output rises, blood pressure may initially decrease then normalize. Risk of varicose veins and edema.
    *   **Respiratory:** Tidal volume increases, respiratory rate may slightly increase, residual volume decreases due to elevated diaphragm. Potential for dyspnea (shortness of breath).
    *   **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea/vomiting ("morning sickness") common early on (hCG related). Increased risk of heartburn, constipation due to displaced stomach/intestines and hormonal effects.
    *   **Urinary:** Increased GFR and urine output. Increased frequency and urgency due to pressure on bladder.
    *   **Integumentary:** Increased skin pigmentation (chloasma, linea nigra).
    *   **Metabolic:** Increased metabolic rate, altered glucose metabolism (potential for gestational diabetes).
*   **Hormonal:** High levels of estrogen, progesterone, hCG, hPL (human placental lactogen) maintain pregnancy, prepare breasts for lactation, and influence maternal metabolism.

## Labor (Parturition):

*   Process of expelling the fetus and placenta from the uterus.
*   **Initiation:** Complex interplay; rising estrogen levels relative to progesterone increase uterine sensitivity to oxytocin. Fetal cortisol may play a role. Stretching of cervix triggers oxytocin release (positive feedback loop).
*   **Stages of Labor:**
    1.  **Dilation Stage:** Longest stage. Begins with regular uterine contractions, ends with full cervical dilation (10 cm). Amniotic sac often ruptures ("water breaks").
    2.  **Expulsion Stage:** From full dilation to delivery of the infant. Strong contractions aided by maternal pushing efforts.
    3.  **Placental Stage:** Delivery of the placenta and fetal membranes (afterbirth), usually within 30 minutes of birth. Uterine contractions continue to limit bleeding.

Pregnancy involves profound maternal adaptations, culminating in labor, a hormonally driven process involving powerful uterine contractions.

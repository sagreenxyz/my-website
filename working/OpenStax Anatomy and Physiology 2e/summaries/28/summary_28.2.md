# Summary: 28.2 Embryonic Development

This section covers the critical period from fertilization through week 8 of gestation, characterized by rapid cell division, differentiation, and the formation of major organ systems.

## Key Stages and Events:

*   **Cleavage (Week 1):** Rapid mitotic divisions of the zygote as it travels down the uterine tube. Forms a **morula** (solid ball of cells) by day 3-4.
*   **Blastocyst Formation (Week 1):** Morula develops a fluid-filled cavity, becoming a **blastocyst** (around day 5). Consists of:
    *   **Trophoblast:** Outer layer of cells; will contribute to the placenta and secrete hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) to maintain the corpus luteum.
    *   **Inner Cell Mass (Embryoblast):** Cluster of cells inside; will form the embryo proper.
*   **Implantation (Week 1-2):** Blastocyst adheres to and embeds within the uterine endometrium (usually starts around day 6-7, completed by day 12). Trophoblast differentiates into:
    *   **Cytotrophoblast:** Inner cellular layer.
    *   **Syncytiotrophoblast:** Outer multinucleated layer that invades endometrium and secretes hCG.
*   **Gastrulation (Week 3):** Formation of the three primary germ layers from the inner cell mass (epiblast). Establishes the body axes.
    *   **Ectoderm (Outer):** Forms nervous system, epidermis (skin, hair, nails).
    *   **Mesoderm (Middle):** Forms muscle, bone, connective tissue, cardiovascular system, kidneys, gonads.
    *   **Endoderm (Inner):** Forms epithelial linings of digestive, respiratory, urinary tracts, and associated glands (liver, pancreas).
*   **Organogenesis (Weeks 3-8):** Formation of body organs and systems from the germ layers.
    *   **Neurulation:** Formation of the neural tube (precursor to brain and spinal cord) from ectoderm.
    *   Development of heart, blood vessels, somites (precursors to vertebrae, ribs, muscles), limb buds, facial features, etc.
*   **Formation of Extraembryonic Membranes:** Support and protect the embryo.
    *   **Amnion:** Forms fluid-filled amniotic sac.
    *   **Yolk Sac:** Forms part of gut, earliest blood cells, germ cells.
    *   **Allantois:** Base for umbilical cord, becomes part of urinary bladder.
    *   **Chorion:** Outermost membrane, forms embryonic part of the placenta.

By the end of week 8, the embryo has a distinctly human appearance, and all major organ systems are established (though immature). This period is highly sensitive to teratogens.

# Summary: 28.5 Adjustments of the Infant at Birth and Postnatal Stages

This section focuses on the dramatic physiological changes an infant undergoes immediately after birth to adapt to life outside the womb, and the key features of the neonatal period.

## Immediate Adjustments at Birth:

*   **First Breath:** Most critical adjustment. Triggered by CO2 buildup, physical stimuli, and temperature change. Lungs inflate, decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance. Requires sufficient surfactant to prevent alveolar collapse.
*   **Circulatory Changes:** Closure of fetal shunts redirects blood flow through the lungs.
    *   **Foramen Ovale:** Closes due to increased pressure in the left atrium (becomes fossa ovalis).
    *   **Ductus Arteriosus:** Constricts in response to increased blood oxygen and prostaglandins changes (becomes ligamentum arteriosum).
    *   **Ductus Venosus:** Constricts, redirecting blood through the liver (becomes ligamentum venosum).
    *   Umbilical arteries and vein constrict and fibrose (become medial umbilical ligaments and ligamentum teres).
*   **Thermoregulation:** Newborns have poor ability to regulate body temperature due to high surface area to volume ratio and limited subcutaneous fat. Rely on brown fat metabolism for non-shivering thermogenesis. Maintaining warmth is crucial.

## Apgar Score:

*   Assessment performed at 1 and 5 minutes after birth to evaluate infant's physical condition.
*   Scores 0, 1, or 2 for five criteria: **A**ppearance (color), **P**ulse (heart rate), **G**rimace (reflex irritability), **A**ctivity (muscle tone), **R**espiration.
*   Total score of 8-10 is normal. Lower scores indicate need for medical attention.

## Neonatal Period (First 28 Days):

*   Period of significant adaptation.
*   **Feeding:** Establishment of feeding (breast or bottle) is vital for hydration, nutrition, and glucose regulation. Initial weight loss is common.
*   **Kidney Function:** Kidneys are immature, limiting ability to concentrate urine; risk of dehydration.
*   **Immune System:** Immature; relies on antibodies acquired from mother (placental transfer - IgG; breast milk - IgA).

The transition from fetal to neonatal life involves rapid and profound physiological adaptations, particularly in the respiratory and circulatory systems.

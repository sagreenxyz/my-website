# Summary: 28.6 Lactation

This section describes the process of milk production and secretion by the mammary glands, including its hormonal control and the composition and benefits of breast milk.

## Physiology of Lactation:

*   **Development:** Mammary glands develop during puberty (estrogen) and further mature during pregnancy (estrogen, progesterone, hPL).
*   **Milk Production (Synthesis):**
    *   Primarily stimulated by **prolactin (PRL)** from the anterior pituitary.
    *   Prolactin levels rise during pregnancy but milk production is inhibited by high levels of estrogen and progesterone.
    *   After birth, the drop in placental hormones allows prolactin to exert its effect.
    *   Suckling stimulates further prolactin release, maintaining milk production (positive feedback).
*   **Milk Ejection (Let-down Reflex):**
    *   Stimulated by **oxytocin** from the posterior pituitary.
    *   Suckling (or even sight/sound of infant) triggers oxytocin release.
    *   Oxytocin causes contraction of myoepithelial cells surrounding alveoli in mammary glands, forcing milk into ducts.

## Composition and Benefits of Breast Milk:

*   **Colostrum:** Yellowish fluid secreted for the first 2-3 days postpartum. Lower in fat, higher in protein, vitamins, minerals, and **antibodies (especially IgA)**. Provides crucial passive immunity and helps clear meconium.
*   **Mature Milk:** Produced from day 3-4 onwards. Composition changes during a feeding (foremilk is watery, hindmilk is richer in fat). Provides:
    *   **Nutrients:** Fats, lactose, proteins optimally suited for infant digestion and growth.
    *   **Water:** Provides necessary hydration.
    *   **Immune Factors:** Antibodies (IgA), lysozyme, lactoferrin, white blood cells, complement - protect against infections.
    *   **Growth Factors:** Promote development, especially of the gut.
*   **Benefits for Infant:** Reduced risk of infections (gastrointestinal, respiratory, ear), allergies, obesity, SIDS. Optimal nutrition and bonding.
*   **Benefits for Mother:** Stimulates uterine contraction (reducing postpartum bleeding), potential for faster return to pre-pregnancy weight, reduced risk of certain cancers (breast, ovarian), bonding.

Lactation is a hormonally regulated process providing ideal nutrition and immune protection for the infant, initiated and maintained by infant suckling.

## Check Your Understanding

1.  Which hormone is primarily responsible for milk production (synthesis), and where is it produced?

# Summary: 27.1 Anatomy and Physiology of the Testicular Reproductive System

This section covers the structures and functions of the reproductive organs responsible for producing sperm and testosterone in individuals assigned male at birth.

## Anatomy:

*   **Testes (Gonads):** Located in the scrotum; produce sperm (spermatogenesis) within seminiferous tubules and testosterone by interstitial (Leydig) cells.
*   **Scrotum:** Sac supporting testes; temperature regulation (slightly below body temp) is crucial for sperm production, controlled by dartos and cremaster muscles.
*   **Duct System:** Pathway for sperm transport and maturation.
    *   **Epididymis:** Site of sperm maturation and storage.
    *   **Ductus (Vas) Deferens:** Transports sperm from epididymis to ejaculatory duct.
    *   **Ejaculatory Duct:** Formed by union of ductus deferens and seminal vesicle duct; passes through prostate to empty into urethra.
    *   **Urethra:** Common passageway for urine and semen; extends through prostate and penis.
*   **Accessory Glands:** Produce seminal fluid, which mixes with sperm to form semen.
    *   **Seminal Vesicles:** Contribute alkaline, fructose-rich fluid (energy for sperm).
    *   **Prostate Gland:** Secretes milky, slightly acidic fluid containing citrate (nutrient) and enzymes (e.g., PSA).
    *   **Bulbourethral (Cowper's) Glands:** Secrete thick, clear mucus prior to ejaculation to neutralize acidic urine residue in urethra.
*   **Penis:** External organ for delivering sperm into the female reproductive tract; contains erectile tissue (corpora cavernosa, corpus spongiosum).

## Physiology:

*   **Spermatogenesis:** Process of sperm production in seminiferous tubules, stimulated by FSH and testosterone. Takes about 64-72 days.
*   **Hormonal Regulation:**
    *   **GnRH (Hypothalamus):** Stimulates anterior pituitary.
    *   **FSH (Anterior Pituitary):** Stimulates spermatogenesis (via Sertoli cells).
    *   **LH (Anterior Pituitary):** Stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone.
    *   **Testosterone:** Responsible for spermatogenesis, development/maintenance of secondary sex characteristics, libido.
    *   **Inhibin (Sertoli Cells):** Inhibits FSH release (negative feedback).
*   **Erection:** Parasympathetic reflex causing vasodilation and engorgement of erectile tissue.
*   **Ejaculation:** Sympathetic reflex causing contraction of ducts and glands, expelling semen.

The system is designed for continuous sperm production and delivery, regulated by a complex interplay of hormones.

# Summary: 27.3 Development of the Male and Female Reproductive Systems

This section outlines the process of sexual differentiation during embryonic and fetal development, leading to the formation of distinct male and female reproductive structures from common precursors.

## Sexual Differentiation:

*   **Genetic Sex:** Determined at fertilization by sex chromosomes (XX for female, XY for male).
*   **Indifferent Stage:** Early embryo has bipotential gonads and two sets of primitive ducts:
    *   **Mesonephric (Wolffian) Ducts:** Potential male internal ducts.
    *   **Paramesonephric (Müllerian) Ducts:** Potential female internal ducts.
    *   External genitalia are also undifferentiated (genital tubercle, urethral folds, labioscrotal swellings).
*   **Male Development:**
    *   **SRY Gene:** Located on the Y chromosome; triggers development of testes from bipotential gonads around week 7.
    *   **Testosterone:** Secreted by fetal testes; stimulates Wolffian ducts to develop into epididymis, ductus deferens, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts. Also required for descent of testes.
    *   **Müllerian-Inhibiting Factor (MIF) / Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH):** Secreted by fetal testes (Sertoli cells); causes Müllerian ducts to degenerate.
    *   **Dihydrotestosterone (DHT):** Converted from testosterone; promotes development of external genitalia (penis, scrotum).
*   **Female Development:**
    *   **Absence of SRY:** Bipotential gonads develop into ovaries (later process).
    *   **Absence of Testosterone:** Wolffian ducts degenerate.
    *   **Absence of MIF:** Müllerian ducts develop into uterine tubes, uterus, and upper part of the vagina.
    *   **Absence of DHT:** External genitalia develop into clitoris, labia minora, and labia majora.
*   **Homologous Structures:** Structures derived from the same embryonic precursor (e.g., testes/ovaries, penis/clitoris, scrotum/labia majora).

## Puberty:

*   Period of sexual maturation where reproductive organs become functional.
*   Triggered by increased secretion of GnRH from hypothalamus, leading to increased FSH/LH from pituitary and sex hormones (testosterone/estrogen) from gonads.
*   Results in development of secondary sexual characteristics and onset of fertility (spermatogenesis/menarche).

Sexual development follows a default female pathway unless directed otherwise by signals (SRY, testosterone, MIF) initiated by the Y chromosome.

# Summary: 11.6 Appendicular Muscles of the Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limbs

This section details the muscles responsible for movement and stabilization of the pelvic girdle and the lower limbs (thigh, leg, ankle, foot, and toes).

## Muscles of the Pelvic Girdle and Hip:

*   **Gluteal Group:** Muscles forming the buttocks (gluteus maximus, medius, minimus, tensor fasciae latae). Primarily responsible for extending, abducting, and rotating the thigh.
*   **Iliopsoas Group:** Major hip flexors (psoas major, iliacus).
*   **Lateral Rotators:** Deep muscles that rotate the thigh laterally (piriformis, obturators, gemelli, quadratus femoris).
*   **Adductor Group:** Muscles on the medial thigh (adductor longus, brevis, magnus; pectineus; gracilis). Primarily adduct and flex the thigh.

## Muscles of the Thigh:

*   **Anterior Compartment (Quadriceps Femoris):** Four muscles (rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius) that extend the leg at the knee. Rectus femoris also flexes the thigh at the hip. Sartorius is also in this compartment (flexes, abducts, laterally rotates thigh; flexes leg).
*   **Posterior Compartment (Hamstrings):** Three muscles (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus) that extend the thigh at the hip and flex the leg at the knee.
*   **Medial Compartment:** Adductor group (see above).

## Muscles of the Leg:

*   **Anterior Compartment:** Primarily dorsiflex the foot and extend the toes (tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus, fibularis tertius).
*   **Lateral Compartment:** Plantar flex and evert the foot (fibularis longus, fibularis brevis).
*   **Posterior Compartment:**
    *   **Superficial:** Plantar flex the foot (gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris). Gastrocnemius also flexes the leg.
    *   **Deep:** Plantar flex the foot, invert the foot, and flex the toes (tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, popliteus).

## Intrinsic Muscles of the Foot:

*   Located entirely within the foot.
*   Support arches and contribute to toe movements (flexion, extension, abduction, adduction).
*   Organized into dorsal and plantar groups.

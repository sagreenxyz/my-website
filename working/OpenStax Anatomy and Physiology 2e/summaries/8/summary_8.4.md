# Summary: 8.4 Bones of the Lower Limb

This section details the bones that form the lower limb, including the thigh, leg, ankle, and foot.

*   **Femur:**
    *   The single bone of the thigh, the longest and strongest bone in the body.
    *   Articulates proximally with the acetabulum of the hip bone (hip joint) and distally with the tibia and patella (knee joint).
    *   Key features: Head, neck, greater and lesser trochanters, linea aspera, medial and lateral condyles.
*   **Patella:**
    *   Sesamoid bone (develops within the quadriceps femoris tendon).
    *   Articulates with the patellar surface of the femur.
    *   Protects the anterior knee joint and improves leverage for knee extension.
*   **Tibia:**
    *   The larger, medial, weight-bearing bone of the leg.
    *   Articulates proximally with the femur and fibula, and distally with the fibula and talus bone of the ankle.
    *   Key features: Medial and lateral condyles, tibial tuberosity, anterior border (shin), medial malleolus.
*   **Fibula:**
    *   The slender, lateral bone of the leg; primarily for muscle attachment, does not bear weight.
    *   Articulates proximally and distally with the tibia.
    *   Key features: Head, lateral malleolus.
*   **Tarsal Bones (Ankle):**
    *   Seven bones forming the posterior foot.
    *   Includes the talus (articulates with tibia and fibula), calcaneus (heel bone, largest tarsal), navicular, cuboid, and three cuneiforms (medial, intermediate, lateral).
*   **Metatarsal Bones (Foot):**
    *   Five bones forming the sole of the foot, numbered I-V from medial to lateral.
    *   Articulate proximally with tarsals and distally with phalanges.
*   **Phalanges (Toes):**
    *   Fourteen bones forming the toes.
    *   The great toe (hallux) has two phalanges (proximal, distal).
    *   The other four toes have three phalanges each (proximal, middle, distal).
*   **Arches of the Foot:**
    *   Medial longitudinal, lateral longitudinal, and transverse arches.
    *   Support body weight, absorb shock, and distribute weight during locomotion. Formed by tarsals, metatarsals, ligaments, and tendons.

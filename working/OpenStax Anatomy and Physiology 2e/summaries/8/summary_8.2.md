# Summary: 8.2 Bones of the Upper Limb

This section covers the bones that constitute the upper limb, including the arm, forearm, wrist, and hand.

*   **Upper Limb Divisions:** Consists of the arm (shoulder to elbow), forearm (elbow to wrist), and hand (wrist and distal). There are 30 bones in each upper limb.
*   **Humerus:**
    *   The single bone of the arm (brachium).
    *   Longest and largest bone of the upper limb.
    *   Articulates proximally with the scapula (glenoid cavity) at the shoulder joint and distally with the radius and ulna at the elbow joint.
    *   Key features: Head, anatomical and surgical necks, greater and lesser tubercles, intertubercular sulcus, deltoid tuberosity, radial groove, trochlea (articulates with ulna), capitulum (articulates with radius), medial and lateral epicondyles, olecranon fossa.
*   **Ulna:**
    *   The medial bone of the forearm (antebrachium) in anatomical position.
    *   Longer than the radius.
    *   Key features: Olecranon (forms point of elbow), trochlear notch (articulates with humerus trochlea), coronoid process, radial notch (articulates with radius head), head (distal end), styloid process.
*   **Radius:**
    *   The lateral bone of the forearm in anatomical position.
    *   Key features: Head (articulates with capitulum and radial notch of ulna), neck, radial tuberosity, styloid process, ulnar notch (articulates with ulna head).
    *   The radius pivots around the ulna to allow pronation and supination of the forearm.
*   **Carpal Bones (Wrist):**
    *   Eight short bones arranged in two rows of four, forming the carpus.
    *   **Proximal Row (lateral to medial):** Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetrum, Pisiform (a sesamoid bone). Mnemonic: "So Long To Pinky"
    *   **Distal Row (lateral to medial):** Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capitate, Hamate. Mnemonic: "Here Comes The Thumb"
    *   Allow complex wrist movements.
*   **Metacarpal Bones (Palm):**
    *   Five bones forming the palm of the hand, numbered I-V from thumb to little finger.
    *   Articulate proximally with distal carpal bones and distally with proximal phalanges.
*   **Phalanges (Fingers):**
    *   Fourteen bones forming the fingers (digits).
    *   The thumb (pollex, digit I) has two phalanges (proximal, distal).
    *   The other four fingers (digits II-V) have three phalanges each (proximal, middle, distal).

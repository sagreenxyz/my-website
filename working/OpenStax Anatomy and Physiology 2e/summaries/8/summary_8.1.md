# Summary: 8.1 The Pectoral Girdle

This section describes the structure and function of the pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle), which attaches the upper limbs to the axial skeleton.

*   **Components:** The pectoral girdle consists of two bones on each side of the body:
    *   **Clavicle (Collarbone):** An S-shaped bone located anteriorly.
    *   **Scapula (Shoulder Blade):** A flat, triangular bone located posteriorly on the thoracic cage.
*   **Function:**
    *   Attaches the upper limb (humerus) to the axial skeleton (sternum).
    *   Provides attachment sites for muscles that move the shoulder and upper limb.
    *   Allows for a wide range of motion at the shoulder joint, greater than any other joint in the body. This mobility comes at the expense of stability.
*   **Clavicle:**
    *   Articulates medially with the manubrium of the sternum (sternoclavicular joint - the only direct bony attachment between the pectoral girdle and the axial skeleton).
    *   Articulates laterally with the acromion of the scapula (acromioclavicular joint).
    *   Acts as a strut to hold the scapula and upper limb laterally, away from the thorax.
    *   Transmits forces from the upper limb to the axial skeleton.
    *   Key features: Sternal end, acromial end, conoid tubercle.
*   **Scapula:**
    *   Lies on the posterior aspect of the rib cage.
    *   Does not directly articulate with the ribs or vertebral column; held in place by muscles.
    *   Key features:
        *   **Body:** Main flat part with superior, medial (vertebral), and lateral (axillary) borders, and superior and inferior angles.
        *   **Glenoid Cavity (Fossa):** Shallow depression on the lateral aspect that articulates with the head of the humerus (glenohumeral joint or shoulder joint).
        *   **Spine:** Prominent ridge on the posterior surface.
        *   **Acromion:** Flattened lateral end of the spine; articulates with the clavicle. Forms the bony tip of the shoulder.
        *   **Coracoid Process:** Hook-like projection anteriorly, inferior to the clavicle; muscle attachment site.
        *   **Supraspinous Fossa:** Depression superior to the spine.
        *   **Infraspinous Fossa:** Depression inferior to the spine.
        *   **Subscapular Fossa:** Depression on the anterior (costal) surface.
*   **Joints:**
    *   **Sternoclavicular (SC) Joint:** Synovial joint between sternum and clavicle.
    *   **Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint:** Synovial joint between acromion and clavicle.
    *   **Glenohumeral Joint:** Synovial ball-and-socket joint between glenoid cavity and humerus head. (Technically part of the upper limb articulation, not the girdle itself).

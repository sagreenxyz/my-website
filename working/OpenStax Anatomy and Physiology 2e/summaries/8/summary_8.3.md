# Summary: 8.3 The Pelvic Girdle and Pelvis

This section describes the structure of the pelvic girdle (hip bones) and the pelvis, which connects the lower limbs to the axial skeleton.

*   **Pelvic Girdle (Hip Girdle):**
    *   Formed by two hip bones (coxal bones or os coxae).
    *   Attaches the lower limb to the axial skeleton.
    *   Provides strong support for the weight of the upper body.
*   **Hip Bone:**
    *   Each hip bone is large and irregular, formed by the fusion of three bones during adolescence:
        *   **Ilium:** Superior, fan-shaped region; forms the largest part. Key features: Iliac crest, anterior/posterior superior iliac spines, greater sciatic notch, auricular surface (for sacroiliac joint).
        *   **Ischium:** Posteroinferior part; forms the "sit bones". Key features: Ischial tuberosity, ischial spine, lesser sciatic notch.
        *   **Pubis:** Anteroinferior part. Key features: Superior/inferior pubic ramus, pubic symphysis (joint between left and right pubic bones), obturator foramen (large opening formed by ischium and pubis).
    *   **Acetabulum:** Deep socket on the lateral surface where the three bones meet; articulates with the head of the femur.
*   **Pelvis:**
    *   Ring-like structure formed by the two hip bones, the sacrum, and the coccyx.
    *   Connects the vertebral column to the femora.
    *   Supports abdominal organs and transmits body weight to the lower limbs.
    *   Divided into:
        *   **Greater Pelvis (False Pelvis):** Superior portion, bounded by the iliac blades; part of the abdominal cavity.
        *   **Lesser Pelvis (True Pelvis):** Inferior portion, enclosed by the sacrum, coccyx, ischium, and pubis; contains pelvic organs. Bounded by the pelvic brim (inlet) superiorly and the pelvic outlet inferiorly.
*   **Joints of the Pelvis:**
    *   **Sacroiliac Joints:** Between the auricular surfaces of the sacrum and ilia; strong, slightly movable joints.
    *   **Pubic Symphysis:** Cartilaginous joint between the two pubic bones anteriorly.
*   **Sex Differences in the Pelvis:**
    *   **Female Pelvis:** Generally wider, shallower, lighter, and has a larger, more circular pelvic inlet and a wider subpubic angle (>80 degrees) to accommodate childbirth. Ischial spines project less medially.
    *   **Male Pelvis:** Generally narrower, deeper, heavier, with a heart-shaped pelvic inlet and a narrower subpubic angle (<70 degrees).

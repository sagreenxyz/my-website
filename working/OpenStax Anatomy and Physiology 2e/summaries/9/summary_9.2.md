# Summary: 9.2 Fibrous Joints

This section details fibrous joints, where bones are joined by dense fibrous connective tissue (rich in collagen fibers). They lack a joint cavity and provide little to no movement. Most are synarthrotic (immovable), though some allow slight movement (amphiarthrotic).

## General Characteristics:

*   **Articulating Bones:** Connected by dense fibrous connective tissue.
*   **Joint Cavity:** Absent.
*   **Movement:** Range from immovable (synarthrotic) to slightly movable (amphiarthrotic). The length of the connective tissue fibers determines the amount of movement.

## Types of Fibrous Joints:

1.  **Sutures:**
    *   **Description:** Occur only between bones of the skull. Articulating bone edges interlock and are joined by very short connective tissue fibers continuous with the periosteum.
    *   **Movement:** Immovable (synarthrotic). Provide protection for the brain.
    *   **Ossification:** In middle age, the fibrous tissue ossifies, and the skull bones fuse into a single unit. This fusion is called a **synostosis** (bony junction).
    *   **Example:** Joints between cranial bones (e.g., coronal suture, sagittal suture). Fontanelles in infants are unossified remnants of fibrous membranes that allow skull growth and compression during birth.
2.  **Syndesmoses (Singular: Syndesmosis):**
    *   **Description:** Bones are connected exclusively by ligaments, cords, or bands of fibrous tissue (longer fibers than in sutures).
    *   **Movement:** Varies from slightly movable (amphiarthrotic) to immovable, depending on the length of the connecting fibers. Longer fibers allow more movement ("give").
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Distal Tibiofibular Joint:** Short fibers connect tibia and fibula; allows very little movement (considered synarthrotic by some, amphiarthrotic by others).
        *   **Interosseous Membrane:** Sheet-like membrane connecting the radius and ulna, or the tibia and fibula along their shafts. Long fibers permit slight movement (amphiarthrotic), such as rotation of the radius over the ulna.
3.  **Gomphoses (Singular: Gomphosis):**
    *   **Description:** Peg-in-socket fibrous joint. The only examples are the articulations of teeth with their alveolar sockets in the mandible and maxilla.
    *   **Connecting Tissue:** The **periodontal ligament** holds the tooth firmly in the socket.
    *   **Movement:** Immovable (synarthrotic) under normal conditions.
    *   **Example:** Tooth in its bony socket.

Fibrous joints primarily serve to hold bones together securely, often providing protection for underlying structures.

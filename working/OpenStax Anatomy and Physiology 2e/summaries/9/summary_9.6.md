# Summary: 9.6 Anatomy of Selected Synovial Joints

This section provides a detailed look at the structure, articulating bones, movements allowed, and stabilizing features of specific major synovial joints in the body.

## Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ):

*   **Articulation:** Mandibular condyle and mandibular fossa/articular tubercle of the temporal bone.
*   **Type:** Modified hinge joint (also allows gliding/translation).
*   **Features:** Articular disc divides cavity into superior (gliding) and inferior (hinge) compartments.
*   **Movements:** Depression, elevation, protraction, retraction, lateral excursion (grinding).
*   **Stability:** Ligaments (lateral ligament).

## Glenohumeral (Shoulder) Joint:

*   **Articulation:** Head of humerus and glenoid cavity of scapula.
*   **Type:** Ball-and-socket joint.
*   **Features:** Most freely moving joint, but least stable. Shallow glenoid cavity deepened slightly by fibrocartilaginous **glenoid labrum**. Thin, loose articular capsule. Several bursae.
*   **Movements:** Flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, medial and lateral rotation.
*   **Stability:** Primarily relies on muscle tendons crossing the joint, especially the **rotator cuff** muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis). Also coracohumeral and glenohumeral ligaments.

## Elbow Joint:

*   **Articulation:** Humerus with ulna (hinge) and radius (hinge/pivot).
*   **Type:** Hinge joint (primarily humeroulnar articulation). Proximal radioulnar joint allows pronation/supination.
*   **Features:** Trochlea of humerus articulates with trochlear notch of ulna; capitulum of humerus with head of radius. Articular capsule relatively thin.
*   **Movements:** Flexion and extension of forearm. (Pronation/supination occur at radioulnar joints).
*   **Stability:** Close fit of trochlea and trochlear notch. Strong collateral ligaments: **ulnar collateral ligament (UCL)** and **radial collateral ligament (RCL)**. Annular ligament encircles radial head, stabilizing proximal radioulnar joint.

## Coxal (Hip) Joint:

*   **Articulation:** Head of femur and acetabulum of hip bone.
*   **Type:** Ball-and-socket joint.
*   **Features:** Deep acetabulum enhanced by fibrocartilaginous **acetabular labrum**. Strong articular capsule. Ligament of the head of the femur (ligamentum teres) contains artery.
*   **Movements:** Flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, medial and lateral rotation (less range than shoulder).
*   **Stability:** Very stable due to deep socket, strong capsule, reinforcing ligaments (iliofemoral, pubofemoral, ischiofemoral), and large surrounding muscles.

## Knee Joint:

*   **Articulation:** Femur with tibia (primary articulation); femur with patella (patellofemoral joint). Fibula is not part of the knee joint proper.
*   **Type:** Primarily a hinge joint (flexion/extension); allows some rotation when flexed. Largest and most complex joint.
*   **Features:** Shallow articular surfaces on tibia. Fibrocartilaginous **medial and lateral menisci** deepen tibial surfaces and absorb shock. Several bursae. Patella enclosed in quadriceps tendon.
*   **Movements:** Flexion, extension, slight medial/lateral rotation (when knee is flexed).
*   **Stability:** Relies heavily on ligaments and muscles.
    *   **Extracapsular Ligaments:** Fibular (lateral) collateral ligament (LCL), Tibial (medial) collateral ligament (MCL), patellar ligament, oblique and arcuate popliteal ligaments.
    *   **Intracapsular Ligaments (Cruciates):** Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) - prevents anterior tibial displacement; Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) - prevents posterior tibial displacement.
    *   **Muscles:** Quadriceps (anteriorly), hamstrings (posteriorly).

# Summary: 9.1 Classification of Joints

This section introduces the concept of joints (articulations) and explains the two primary ways they are classified: structurally and functionally.

## Definition of a Joint (Articulation):

*   A site where two or more bones meet.
*   Joints give the skeleton mobility and hold it together.

## Functional Classification:

*   Based on the **amount of movement** allowed at the joint.
*   **Synarthroses (Singular: Synarthrosis):**
    *   Immovable joints.
    *   Movement is minimal or non-existent.
    *   Common in the axial skeleton where stability and protection are key (e.g., sutures in the skull).
*   **Amphiarthroses (Singular: Amphiarthrosis):**
    *   Slightly movable joints.
    *   Allow limited movement.
    *   Also common in the axial skeleton (e.g., intervertebral discs, pubic symphysis).
*   **Diarthroses (Singular: Diarthrosis):**
    *   Freely movable joints.
    *   Allow a wide range of motion.
    *   Predominate in the limbs (appendicular skeleton).

## Structural Classification:

*   Based on the **material binding the bones together** and the **presence or absence of a joint cavity**.
*   **Fibrous Joints:**
    *   Bones joined by dense fibrous connective tissue.
    *   No joint cavity.
    *   Most are synarthrotic (immovable), though some are amphiarthrotic (slightly movable).
    *   **Types:** Sutures, Syndesmoses, Gomphoses.
*   **Cartilaginous Joints:**
    *   Bones united by cartilage (hyaline or fibrocartilage).
    *   No joint cavity.
    *   Most are amphiarthrotic (slightly movable), though some are synarthrotic (immovable).
    *   **Types:** Synchondroses, Symphyses.
*   **Synovial Joints:**
    *   Articulating bones are separated by a fluid-containing joint cavity.
    *   All are diarthrotic (freely movable), though mobility varies.
    *   Include nearly all joints of the limbs and most joints of the body.
    *   Characterized by articular cartilage, joint cavity, articular capsule, synovial fluid, and reinforcing ligaments.

**Relationship:** There is often overlap between classifications. Fibrous joints are mostly synarthrotic. Cartilaginous joints are mostly amphiarthrotic. All synovial joints are diarthrotic. The structural classification provides a more precise way to categorize joints.

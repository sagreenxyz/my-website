# Summary: 9.5 Types of Body Movements

This section categorizes and describes the various types of movements possible at synovial joints. Movements result from muscle contractions pulling on bones across these joints.

## General Types of Movements:

1.  **Gliding (Translation):**
    *   One flat or nearly flat bone surface glides or slips over another without significant angulation or rotation.
    *   Occurs at intercarpal joints, intertarsal joints, and between articular processes of vertebrae.
2.  **Angular Movements:**
    *   Increase or decrease the angle between two bones. Occur in sagittal, frontal, or transverse planes.
    *   **Flexion:** Decreases the angle of the joint, bringing articulating bones closer together (usually in sagittal plane).
    *   **Extension:** Increases the angle of the joint, straightening a limb or body part (opposite of flexion).
    *   **Hyperextension:** Extension beyond the anatomical position or normal range of motion.
    *   **Abduction:** Movement of a limb *away* from the midline of the body (in frontal plane). For fingers/toes, midline is longest digit.
    *   **Adduction:** Movement of a limb *toward* the midline of the body (opposite of abduction).
    *   **Circumduction:** Movement of a limb so that it describes a cone in space. Distal end moves in a circle while the point of origin is relatively stationary. Combines flexion, abduction, extension, and adduction in succession.
3.  **Rotation:**
    *   Turning of a bone around its own long axis.
    *   **Medial (Internal) Rotation:** Anterior surface of the bone turns toward the midline.
    *   **Lateral (External) Rotation:** Anterior surface of the bone turns away from the midline.
    *   Occurs at hip, shoulder, and between C1/C2 vertebrae (atlantoaxial joint).

## Special Movements:

*   Certain movements occur only at specific joints.
*   **Supination & Pronation (Radius/Ulna):**
    *   **Supination:** Forearm rotates laterally so palm faces anteriorly or superiorly (radius and ulna are parallel). "Holding soup".
    *   **Pronation:** Forearm rotates medially so palm faces posteriorly or inferiorly (radius crosses over ulna).
*   **Dorsiflexion & Plantar Flexion (Ankle):**
    *   **Dorsiflexion:** Lifting the foot so its superior surface approaches the shin (bending foot upward).
    *   **Plantar Flexion:** Depressing the foot (pointing the toes downward).
*   **Inversion & Eversion (Foot - Intertarsal Joints):**
    *   **Inversion:** Sole of the foot turns medially.
    *   **Eversion:** Sole of the foot turns laterally.
*   **Protraction & Retraction (Transverse Plane):**
    *   **Protraction:** Moving a body part anteriorly (e.g., jutting jaw forward, moving scapula forward).
    *   **Retraction:** Moving a body part posteriorly (opposite of protraction).
*   **Elevation & Depression (Frontal Plane):**
    *   **Elevation:** Lifting a body part superiorly (e.g., shrugging shoulders, closing mouth).
    *   **Depression:** Moving the elevated part inferiorly (opposite of elevation).
*   **Opposition (Thumb):** Movement of the thumb to touch the tips of the other fingers on the same hand. Allows grasping. Unique to saddle joint of thumb (carpometacarpal joint).

## Check Your Understanding

1.  Define rotation as a type of body movement.
2.  What is the difference between medial (internal) and lateral (external) rotation?
3.  Provide two examples of joints where rotation occurs.
4.  Besides the hip and shoulder, name another specific joint where rotation is a key movement.

# Summary: 22.2 The Lungs

This section details the gross anatomy of the lungs, their blood supply, innervation, and the structure of the pleural membranes surrounding them.

## Gross Anatomy of the Lungs:

*   **Location:** Occupy the majority of the thoracic cavity, flanking the mediastinum.
*   **Apex:** Superior tip, deep to the clavicle.
*   **Base:** Inferior surface resting on the diaphragm.
*   **Hilum:** Indentation on the mediastinal surface where pulmonary/systemic blood vessels, bronchi, lymphatic vessels, and nerves enter/exit. These structures form the lung **root**.
*   **Costal Surface:** Anterior, lateral, and posterior surfaces in close contact with the ribs.
*   **Lobes:** Lungs are divided into lobes by deep fissures.
    *   **Right Lung:** Larger; has three lobes (Superior, Middle, Inferior) separated by the oblique and horizontal fissures.
    *   **Left Lung:** Smaller (due to heart position); has two lobes (Superior, Inferior) separated by the oblique fissure. Features the **cardiac notch** (concavity accommodating the heart).
*   **Bronchopulmonary Segments:** Each lobe is further divided into pyramid-shaped segments separated by connective tissue septa. Each segment is served by its own tertiary (segmental) bronchus and artery/vein. Clinically important as disease is often confined to one segment, allowing surgical removal without damaging others. (Typically 10 segments per lung).
*   **Lobules:** Smallest subdivisions visible macroscopically; appear as hexagons on the lung surface. Each served by a large bronchiole and its branches.
*   **Stroma:** Lung tissue is mostly elastic connective tissue ("stroma"), giving lungs their soft, spongy, elastic quality.

## Blood Supply and Innervation:

*   **Pulmonary Circulation:** Transports deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs for oxygenation and returns oxygenated blood to the left atrium.
    *   **Pulmonary Arteries:** Deliver deoxygenated blood; branch extensively alongside bronchi, feeding into the pulmonary capillary networks surrounding alveoli.
    *   **Pulmonary Veins:** Collect oxygenated blood from capillaries and return it to the left atrium.
    *   Low-pressure, high-volume system. Lung capillary endothelium contains enzymes (e.g., ACE).
*   **Bronchial Circulation:** Provides oxygenated systemic blood to lung tissues themselves (bronchi, connective tissue, visceral pleura), except alveoli (nourished by pulmonary capillaries).
    *   **Bronchial Arteries:** Arise from aorta, enter at hilum, run along bronchi.
    *   **Bronchial Veins:** Drain some deoxygenated blood, anastomose with pulmonary veins (returning mixed blood to left atrium).
*   **Innervation:** Lungs innervated by parasympathetic and sympathetic motor fibers, and visceral sensory fibers via the **pulmonary plexus** entering at the root.
    *   *Parasympathetic:* Cause bronchoconstriction.
    *   *Sympathetic:* Cause bronchodilation.
    *   *Sensory:* Involved in reflexes (e.g., cough).

## Pleurae:

*   **Definition:** Thin, double-layered serous membranes surrounding each lung.
    *   **Parietal Pleura:** Lines the thoracic wall, superior diaphragm, around heart, between lungs.
    *   **Visceral Pleura:** Covers the external lung surface, dipping into fissures.
*   **Pleural Cavity:** Potential space between the parietal and visceral pleurae.
*   **Pleural Fluid:** Fills the pleural cavity. Produced by pleurae. Lubricates, allowing lungs to glide easily during breathing. Creates surface tension that helps hold lungs tightly to the thoracic wall (essential for lung expansion).
*   **Pleurisy:** Inflammation of the pleurae, often resulting in friction and stabbing pain with breathing.

The lungs are paired organs divided into lobes and segments, housed within the pleurae. They have dual blood supplies (pulmonary for gas exchange, bronchial for tissue nourishment) and autonomic innervation controlling airway diameter. The pleurae provide lubrication and maintain lung expansion.

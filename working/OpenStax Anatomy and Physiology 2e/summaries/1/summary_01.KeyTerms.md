This section lists important terminology related to the introductory concepts of anatomy and physiology discussed in Chapter 1.

*(Note: The specific terms are derived from the HTML content. Below is a representation of the types of terms typically found.)*

*   **Anatomical Position:** Standard reference posture (standing erect, feet parallel, arms at sides, palms forward).
*   **Anatomy:** Study of the structure of the body.
*   **Control Center:** Component of a feedback loop that compares value to normal range.
*   **Effector:** Component of a feedback loop that causes a change to reverse the situation or amplify it.
*   **Homeostasis:** Maintenance of a relatively stable internal environment.
*   **Negative Feedback:** Mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point.
*   **Physiology:** Study of the function of the body.
*   **Positive Feedback:** Mechanism that intensifies a change in the body's physiological condition.
*   **Prone:** Face-down orientation.
*   **Receptor (Sensor):** Component of a feedback loop that monitors a physiological value.
*   **Set Point:** Ideal value for a physiological parameter.
*   **Supine:** Face-up orientation.
*   **Abdominopelvic Cavity:** Inferior body cavity subdivided into abdominal and pelvic cavities.
*   **Cranial Cavity:** Body cavity housing the brain.
*   **Diaphragm:** Muscle separating thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities.
*   **Dorsal (Posterior) Cavity:** Posterior body cavity containing cranial and spinal cavities.
*   **Frontal (Coronal) Plane:** Vertical plane dividing body into anterior and posterior portions.
*   **Gross Anatomy:** Study of larger structures visible without magnification.
*   **Microscopic Anatomy:** Study of structures requiring magnification (cytology, histology).
*   **Organ:** Functionally distinct structure composed of two or more tissue types.
*   **Organ System:** Group of organs working together.
*   **Pleura:** Serous membrane lining the pleural cavity and covering the lungs.
*   **Pericardium:** Serous membrane lining the pericardial cavity and covering the heart.
*   **Peritoneum:** Serous membrane lining the abdominopelvic cavity and covering its organs.
*   **Sagittal Plane:** Vertical plane dividing body into right and left portions (midsagittal if equal).
*   **Serous Membrane:** Thin membrane covering walls and organs in thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities.
*   **Thoracic Cavity:** Superior body cavity enclosed by rib cage, containing lungs and heart.
*   **Tissue:** Group of similar cells performing a specific function.
*   **Transverse Plane:** Horizontal plane dividing body into superior and inferior portions.
*   **Ventral (Anterior) Cavity:** Anterior body cavity including thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities.
*   **X-ray, CT, MRI, PET, Ultrasound:** Medical imaging techniques.

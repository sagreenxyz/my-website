# Summary: Chapter 1 Chapter Review - An Introduction to the Human Body

This chapter review consolidates the foundational information presented about human anatomy and physiology.

## Key Concepts Recapped:

*   **1.1 Overview of Anatomy and Physiology:** Defines anatomy (structure) and physiology (function) and their sub-disciplines. Emphasizes the complementarity of structure and function.
*   **1.2 Structural Organization:** Describes the levels of organization from chemical to organismal (chemical, cellular, tissue, organ, organ system, organism). Briefly introduces the 11 major organ systems.
*   **1.3 Functions of Human Life:** Outlines the essential functions distinguishing living organisms (organization, metabolism, responsiveness, movement, development, reproduction). Lists the requirements for life (oxygen, nutrients, narrow temperature/pressure ranges).
*   **1.4 Homeostasis:** Explains the concept of maintaining a stable internal environment. Details the components of feedback loops (receptor, control center, effector) and contrasts negative feedback (most common, corrective) with positive feedback (amplifying).
*   **1.5 Anatomical Terminology:** Defines anatomical position. Explains directional terms (anterior/posterior, superior/inferior, etc.), regional terms, body planes (sagittal, frontal, transverse), and body cavities (dorsal: cranial, vertebral; ventral: thoracic, abdominopelvic) including their associated serous membranes (pleura, pericardium, peritoneum).
*   **1.6 Medical Imaging:** Briefly introduces common techniques used to visualize internal body structures (X-ray, CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound).

The chapter establishes the framework and language necessary for studying the human body in subsequent chapters.

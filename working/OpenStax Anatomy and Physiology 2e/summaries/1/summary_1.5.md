# Summary: 1.5 Homeostasis

This section explains the concept of homeostasis, the body's ability to maintain relatively stable internal conditions despite continuous changes in the internal or external environment, and the mechanisms involved.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Homeostasis:** Maintenance of a stable internal environment within narrow physiological limits (e.g., body temperature, blood glucose, pH). It's a dynamic state of equilibrium.
*   **Set Point:** The physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates.
*   **Normal Range:** The restricted set of values that is optimally healthful and stable.
*   **Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms used to control and maintain homeostasis. Components:
    *   **Sensor (Receptor):** Monitors the physiological value and detects deviations from the set point.
    *   **Control Center:** Compares the value to the normal range and determines the appropriate response. Often in the brain.
    *   **Effector:** Causes a response that adjusts the value back towards the normal range.
*   **Negative Feedback:** The most common mechanism. The effector's response *reduces* or shuts off the original stimulus, bringing the variable back towards the set point (e.g., regulation of body temperature, blood glucose). Prevents severe changes.
*   **Positive Feedback:** Less common. The effector's response *enhances* or exaggerates the original stimulus, pushing the variable further from the set point. Usually controls infrequent events that need to be completed quickly (e.g., blood clotting, labor contractions). Has a self-limiting endpoint.

Homeostasis is essential for survival; its disruption can lead to disease or death.

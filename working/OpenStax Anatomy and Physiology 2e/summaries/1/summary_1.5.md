# Summary: 1.5 Homeostasis

This section explains the concept of homeostasis, the body's ability to maintain relatively stable internal conditions despite continuous changes in the internal or external environment, and the mechanisms involved.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Homeostasis:** Maintenance of a stable internal environment within narrow physiological limits (e.g., body temperature, blood glucose, pH). It's a dynamic state of equilibrium.
*   **Set Point:** The physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates.
*   **Normal Range:** The restricted set of values that is optimally healthful and stable.
*   **Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms used to control and maintain homeostasis. Components:
    *   **Sensor (Receptor):** Monitors the physiological value and detects deviations from the set point.
    *   **Control Center:** Compares the value to the normal range and determines the appropriate response. Often in the brain.
    *   **Effector:** Causes a response that adjusts the value back towards the normal range.
*   **Negative Feedback:** The most common mechanism. The effector's response *reduces* or shuts off the original stimulus, bringing the variable back towards the set point (e.g., regulation of body temperature, blood glucose). Prevents severe changes.
*   **Positive Feedback:** Less common. The effector's response *enhances* or exaggerates the original stimulus, pushing the variable further from the set point. Usually controls infrequent events that need to be completed quickly (e.g., blood clotting, labor contractions). Has a self-limiting endpoint.

Homeostasis is essential for survival; its disruption can lead to disease or death.

Understanding body cavities and their associated membranes is important for locating organs and understanding their protection and potential spread of infection.

## Check Your Understanding

1.  Name the two major dorsal body cavities and list the primary organs found within each.
2.  What major structure separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominopelvic cavity?
3.  Name the three main parts of the thoracic cavity.
4.  What are serous membranes (serosae)? Describe their general structure, including the parietal layer, visceral layer, and serous fluid. What is the function of serous fluid?
5.  List the nine abdominopelvic regions and identify one organ predominantly located in the umbilical region and one in the right hypochondriac region.

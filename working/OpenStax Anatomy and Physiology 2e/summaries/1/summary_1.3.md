# Summary: 1.3 Functions of Human Life

This section outlines the fundamental processes necessary for maintaining human life, distinguishing living organisms from non-living matter.

## Key Life Functions:

*   **Organization:** Maintaining distinct internal compartments and boundaries (e.g., cells, organs). Structures are organized to perform specific functions.
*   **Metabolism:** The sum of all chemical reactions in the body.
    *   **Anabolism:** Building complex molecules from simpler ones (requires energy).
    *   **Catabolism:** Breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones (releases energy).
*   **Responsiveness (Irritability):** Ability to sense and react to changes (stimuli) in the internal or external environment.
*   **Movement:** Includes motion of the whole body, individual organs, cells, and structures within cells.
*   **Development:** All changes the body goes through in life, including growth (increase in size) and differentiation (specialization of cells).
*   **Growth:** Increase in body size, achieved by increasing cell number, cell size, or the amount of non-cellular material around cells.
*   **Reproduction:** Formation of a new organism from parent organisms (cellular or organismal level). Essential for species survival.

These functions are interrelated and necessary for survival.

# Summary: 1.7 Medical Imaging

This section describes various techniques used to create images of the internal structures of the human body for diagnostic purposes, allowing visualization without surgery.

## Common Imaging Techniques:

*   **X-rays:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Uses short-wavelength electromagnetic radiation. Dense tissues (like bone) absorb more radiation, appearing white; less dense tissues appear darker.
    *   **Uses:** Best for visualizing bones (fractures) and dense structures (tumors, pneumonia).
    *   **Limitations:** Soft tissues not well visualized; involves radiation exposure. Contrast agents (e.g., barium) can enhance visualization of hollow organs.
*   **Computed Tomography (CT) / CAT Scan:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Uses X-rays taken from multiple angles around the body; computer reconstructs detailed cross-sectional images ("slices").
    *   **Uses:** Excellent for visualizing bone, soft tissues, and blood vessels. Widely used for trauma, cancer detection, vascular issues.
    *   **Limitations:** Higher radiation dose than standard X-ray; relatively expensive.
*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Uses powerful magnets and radio waves to align and then detect the energy released by hydrogen atoms (mostly in water) within tissues. Computer generates detailed images.
    *   **Uses:** Excellent for visualizing soft tissues, particularly brain, spinal cord, nerves, muscles, ligaments, tendons. Does not use ionizing radiation.
    *   **Limitations:** Expensive; slow; cannot be used with metallic implants or pacemakers; noisy and confining. Functional MRI (fMRI) can map brain activity.
*   **Positron Emission Tomography (PET):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Patient ingests or is injected with a short-lived radioactive tracer tagged to a biologically active molecule (like glucose). Scanner detects gamma rays emitted where the tracer accumulates (areas of high metabolic activity).
    *   **Uses:** Primarily used to observe metabolic processes and blood flow. Useful in oncology (detecting cancer spread), cardiology, and neurology (brain activity). Often combined with CT or MRI for anatomical reference.
    *   **Limitations:** Involves radiation exposure; relatively low resolution of structures; expensive.
*   **Ultrasonography (Ultrasound):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Uses high-frequency sound waves emitted by a transducer. Waves echo back from tissues; computer creates an image (sonogram) based on echo patterns.
    *   **Uses:** Very safe (no ionizing radiation), inexpensive, real-time imaging. Commonly used in obstetrics (fetal monitoring), cardiology (echocardiogram), visualizing abdominal/pelvic organs, blood flow (Doppler ultrasound).
    *   **Limitations:** Image quality depends on operator skill; sound waves do not penetrate bone or air well.

Medical imaging techniques provide invaluable tools for diagnosing diseases and injuries by visualizing internal body structures and functions.

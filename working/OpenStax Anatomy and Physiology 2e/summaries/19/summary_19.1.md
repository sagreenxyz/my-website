# Summary: 19.1 Heart Anatomy

This section describes the location, structure, and organization of the human heart.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Location:** Situated within the thoracic cavity, medially between the lungs in the mediastinum. Rests on the diaphragm, oriented with the apex pointing inferiorly and to the left. Enclosed within the pericardium.
*   **Pericardium:** A double-walled sac surrounding the heart.
    *   *Fibrous Pericardium:* Tough, outer protective layer, anchors the heart.
    *   *Serous Pericardium:* Inner layer with two parts:
        *   *Parietal Layer:* Fused to the fibrous pericardium.
        *   *Visceral Layer (Epicardium):* Covers the heart surface.
    *   *Pericardial Cavity:* Space between parietal and visceral layers, contains lubricating serous fluid.
*   **Heart Wall Layers:**
    *   *Epicardium:* Outermost layer (visceral layer of serous pericardium).
    *   *Myocardium:* Middle layer, thickest, composed of cardiac muscle tissue responsible for pumping.
    *   *Endocardium:* Innermost layer, simple squamous epithelium lining chambers and valves, continuous with blood vessel endothelium.
*   **Chambers:** Four chambers:
    *   *Right Atrium:* Receives deoxygenated blood from systemic circulation (SVC, IVC, coronary sinus).
    *   *Right Ventricle:* Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the pulmonary trunk.
    *   *Left Atrium:* Receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via pulmonary veins.
    *   *Left Ventricle:* Pumps oxygenated blood to the systemic circulation via the aorta (has the thickest myocardium).
*   **Septa:** Internal walls dividing the heart:
    *   *Interatrial Septum:* Separates the atria (contains fossa ovalis).
    *   *Interventricular Septum:* Separates the ventricles.
*   **Valves:** Ensure unidirectional blood flow, preventing backflow.
    *   *Atrioventricular (AV) Valves:* Between atria and ventricles.
        *   *Tricuspid Valve:* Between right atrium and right ventricle.
        *   *Mitral (Bicuspid) Valve:* Between left atrium and left ventricle.
        *   Chordae tendineae and papillary muscles prevent valve cusps from everting into atria during ventricular contraction.
    *   *Semilunar (SL) Valves:* Between ventricles and major arteries.
        *   *Pulmonary Valve:* Between right ventricle and pulmonary trunk.
        *   *Aortic Valve:* Between left ventricle and aorta.
*   **Coronary Circulation:** Blood supply to the myocardium itself.
    *   *Coronary Arteries:* Branch from the aorta to supply oxygenated blood.
    *   *Cardiac Veins:* Drain deoxygenated blood into the coronary sinus, which empties into the right atrium.

The heart is a four-chambered muscular pump with valves ensuring one-way blood flow through pulmonary and systemic circuits, nourished by its own coronary circulation.

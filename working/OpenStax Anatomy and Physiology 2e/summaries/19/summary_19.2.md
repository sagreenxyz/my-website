# Summary: 19.2 Cardiac Muscle and Electrical Activity

This section examines the unique properties of cardiac muscle tissue and the heart's intrinsic conduction system.

## Cardiac Muscle Tissue (Myocardium):

*   **Structure:** Striated, short, branched cells connected by intercalated discs. Typically uninucleated. Abundant mitochondria for high aerobic respiration demands.
*   **Intercalated Discs:** Contain:
    *   *Desmosomes:* Anchor cells together, preventing separation during contraction.
    *   *Gap Junctions:* Allow ions to pass freely between cells, creating a functional syncytium (atrial and ventricular) where muscle cells contract as a coordinated unit.
*   **Contraction Mechanism:** Similar to skeletal muscle (sliding filament theory), but with differences:
    *   *Calcium Source:* Ca2+ influx from both sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and extracellular fluid is required for contraction (calcium-induced calcium release).
    *   *Action Potential:* Longer duration due to a plateau phase caused by slow Ca2+ influx, preventing tetanic contractions and allowing time for chamber filling.
    *   *Refractory Period:* Long absolute refractory period prevents summation and tetanus.

## Cardiac Conduction System:

*   **Autorhythmicity:** Specialized cardiac muscle cells (pacemaker cells) can spontaneously depolarize and initiate action potentials without nervous system input.
*   **Components (in order of signal propagation):**
    1.  **Sinoatrial (SA) Node:** Located in the right atrial wall; the primary pacemaker, setting the intrinsic heart rate (sinus rhythm, ~75 bpm). Has the fastest depolarization rate.
    2.  **Atrioventricular (AV) Node:** Located in the interatrial septum; delays the impulse (~0.1s) allowing atria to complete contraction before ventricles contract.
    3.  **Atrioventricular (AV) Bundle (Bundle of His):** Located in the interventricular septum; the only electrical connection between atria and ventricles.
    4.  **Right and Left Bundle Branches:** Course through the interventricular septum towards the apex.
    5.  **Purkinje Fibers:** Penetrate the apex and turn superiorly into the ventricular walls, distributing the impulse rapidly to ventricular muscle cells, leading to coordinated ventricular contraction from the apex upwards.
*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG):** A recording of the electrical activity of the heart during a cardiac cycle. Detects depolarization and repolarization waves.
    *   *P Wave:* Atrial depolarization.
    *   *QRS Complex:* Ventricular depolarization (masks atrial repolarization).
    *   *T Wave:* Ventricular repolarization.
    *   Intervals (P-R, Q-T) and segments (S-T) provide information about conduction times and heart health.

Cardiac muscle's unique structure and the intrinsic conduction system ensure coordinated, rhythmic contractions essential for pumping blood. The ECG provides a non-invasive view of this electrical activity.

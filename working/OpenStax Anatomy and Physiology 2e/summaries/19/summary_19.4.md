# Summary: 19.4 Cardiac Physiology

This section explores the factors influencing heart function, particularly cardiac output and its regulation.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Cardiac Output (CO):** The amount of blood pumped by each ventricle in one minute. It is the primary measure of heart efficiency.
    *   **Formula:** CO = Heart Rate (HR) Ã— Stroke Volume (SV)
    *   Units: mL/min or L/min.
    *   Typical resting CO is ~5 L/min, but can increase significantly during exercise.
*   **Cardiac Reserve:** The difference between maximum CO and resting CO.
*   **Regulation of Stroke Volume (SV):** SV = EDV - ESV. Factors affecting SV:
    *   **Preload:** The degree of stretch of cardiac muscle cells just before they contract. Related to EDV.
        *   *Frank-Starling Law of the Heart:* Increased preload (within physiological limits) leads to increased force of contraction and thus increased SV. Venous return is the most significant factor affecting preload/EDV.
    *   **Contractility:** The contractile strength achieved at a given muscle length, independent of stretch/EDV. Increased contractility lowers ESV and increases SV.
        *   *Positive Inotropic Agents:* Increase contractility (e.g., Ca2+, sympathetic stimulation via norepinephrine/epinephrine, thyroxine, glucagon, digitalis).
        *   *Negative Inotropic Agents:* Decrease contractility (e.g., acidosis, increased extracellular K+, calcium channel blockers).
    *   **Afterload:** The pressure that the ventricles must overcome to eject blood (back pressure exerted by arterial blood). Primarily the diastolic pressure in the aorta and pulmonary trunk.
        *   Increased afterload (e.g., hypertension) increases ESV, reduces SV.
*   **Regulation of Heart Rate (HR):**
    *   **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):**
        *   *Sympathetic Nervous System:* Increases HR (and contractility) via norepinephrine acting on SA/AV nodes and myocardium. Dominant during stress/exercise.
        *   *Parasympathetic Nervous System (Vagus Nerve):* Decreases HR via acetylcholine acting on SA/AV nodes. Dominant at rest (vagal tone).
        *   Cardiovascular centers in the medulla oblongata receive input (baroreceptors, chemoreceptors, proprioceptors, higher brain centers) and modulate ANS output.
    *   **Chemical Regulation:**
        *   *Hormones:* Epinephrine, norepinephrine (adrenal medulla), thyroxine increase HR.
        *   *Ions:* Imbalances in Ca2+ and K+ can significantly affect HR and rhythm.
    *   **Other Factors:** Age, gender, physical fitness, body temperature influence resting HR.

Cardiac output is dynamically adjusted by regulating both heart rate and stroke volume through neural, hormonal, and intrinsic mechanisms to meet the body's changing metabolic demands.

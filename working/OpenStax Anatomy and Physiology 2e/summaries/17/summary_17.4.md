# Summary: 17.4 The Thyroid Gland

This section describes the anatomy, location, histology, and hormones of the thyroid gland.

## Anatomy and Location:

*   Butterfly-shaped gland located in the anterior neck, on the trachea just inferior to the larynx.
*   Consists of two lateral lobes connected by a median tissue mass called the isthmus.
*   Largest pure endocrine gland in the body.

## Histology:

*   Composed of hollow, spherical **follicles**.
*   Follicle walls are formed by cuboidal or squamous epithelial cells called **follicular cells**.
*   Follicular cells produce **thyroglobulin**, a glycoprotein precursor to thyroid hormone.
*   The central cavity (lumen) of the follicle stores **colloid**, an amber-colored sticky material consisting of thyroglobulin molecules with attached iodine atoms. Thyroid hormone is derived from this iodinated thyroglobulin.
*   **Parafollicular cells (C cells)** lie in the connective tissue between follicles. They produce **calcitonin**.

## Thyroid Hormones (TH):

*   The body's major metabolic hormones. Affect virtually every cell.
*   Two related iodine-containing amine hormones:
    *   **Thyroxine (T4):** Major hormone secreted by thyroid follicles. Has 4 bound iodine atoms.
    *   **Triiodothyronine (T3):** Most formed at target tissues by conversion of T4 to T3. Has 3 bound iodine atoms. T3 is more potent/active than T4.
*   **Synthesis:** Involves iodination of tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin within the colloid, coupling of iodinated tyrosines to form T3 and T4 (still attached to thyroglobulin), endocytosis of colloid, lysosomal cleavage to release free T3 and T4 into bloodstream. Requires iodine uptake by follicular cells.
*   **Transport:** T3 and T4 bind to transport proteins (mainly thyroxine-binding globulin - TBG) in blood.
*   **Mechanism:** Act as lipid-soluble hormones, entering cells and binding to intracellular receptors to regulate gene transcription.
*   **Effects:**
    *   Increases basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body heat production (calorigenic effect).
    *   Regulates tissue growth and development (critical for skeletal/nervous system development and reproduction).
    *   Maintains blood pressure (increases adrenergic receptors in blood vessels).
*   **Regulation:** Release stimulated by TSH from anterior pituitary (which is stimulated by TRH from hypothalamus). Rising TH levels inhibit TSH and TRH release (negative feedback).

## Calcitonin:

*   Polypeptide hormone produced by parafollicular (C) cells.
*   **Function:** Lowers blood Ca2+ levels, primarily by inhibiting osteoclast activity (bone resorption) and stimulating Ca2+ uptake and incorporation into bone matrix.
*   **Regulation:** Released in response to high blood Ca2+ levels. Effects are generally weak in adult humans; PTH is the main regulator of blood Ca2+.

The thyroid gland plays a critical role in metabolism, growth, and development through its production of thyroid hormones, and contributes minorly to calcium homeostasis via calcitonin.

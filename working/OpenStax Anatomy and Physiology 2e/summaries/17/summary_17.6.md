# Summary: 17.6 The Adrenal Glands

This section covers the structure, location, and hormones of the adrenal (suprarenal) glands, which play key roles in stress response and electrolyte balance.

## Anatomy and Location:

*   Paired, pyramid-shaped glands sitting atop the kidneys.
*   Structurally and functionally two distinct endocrine glands in one:
    1.  **Adrenal Cortex:** Outer portion, glandular tissue derived from embryonic mesoderm. Synthesizes corticosteroids.
    2.  **Adrenal Medulla:** Inner portion, nervous tissue derived from neural crest; part of the sympathetic nervous system. Synthesizes catecholamines.

## Adrenal Cortex Hormones (Corticosteroids):

*   Synthesizes over two dozen steroid hormones from cholesterol. Grouped into three layers (zones), each producing different corticosteroids:
    1.  **Zona Glomerulosa (Outer layer): Mineralocorticoids**
        *   Mainly **Aldosterone**.
        *   **Function:** Regulates electrolyte (mineral salt) concentrations in extracellular fluids, particularly Na+ and K+. Stimulates Na+ reabsorption (and water retention) and K+ excretion by the kidneys. Maintains blood volume and pressure.
        *   **Regulation:** Primarily stimulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism (activated by low blood pressure/volume), rising blood K+ levels, and ACTH (minor influence). Inhibited by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).
    2.  **Zona Fasciculata (Middle layer): Glucocorticoids**
        *   Mainly **Cortisol** (hydrocortisone). Also corticosterone and cortisone.
        *   **Function:** Influence energy metabolism, help resist stressors. Maintain blood glucose levels (gluconeogenesis), maintain blood pressure (vasoconstrictive action). Depress inflammatory and immune responses (at high levels).
        *   **Regulation:** Release stimulated by ACTH from anterior pituitary (which is stimulated by CRH from hypothalamus). Follows diurnal rhythm (highest in morning). Stress overrides normal feedback inhibition.
    3.  **Zona Reticularis (Inner layer): Gonadocorticoids (Adrenal Androgens)**
        *   Mainly weak androgens like **androstenedione** and **dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)**. Converted to testosterone or estrogens in tissues.
        *   **Function:** Contribute to axillary/pubic hair development, female libido, estrogen source after menopause. Insignificant effects compared to gonadal hormones in males.
        *   **Regulation:** Stimulated by ACTH; mechanism not fully understood.

## Adrenal Medulla Hormones (Catecholamines):

*   Contains **chromaffin cells** (modified postganglionic sympathetic neurons).
*   Synthesizes **Epinephrine** (adrenaline, ~80%) and **Norepinephrine** (noradrenaline, ~20%).
*   **Function:** Mediate short-term stress response ("fight-or-flight"). Effects mimic sympathetic nervous system activation but are longer lasting. Increase heart rate and contractility, increase metabolic rate, increase blood glucose levels (glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis), dilate bronchioles, redirect blood flow to essential organs.
*   **Regulation:** Stimulated by preganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers during acute stress.

The adrenal glands produce hormones vital for coping with stress (both short-term via medulla and long-term via cortex) and maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure.

# Summary: 17.3 The Pituitary Gland and Hypothalamus

This section describes the structure and function of the pituitary gland (hypophysis) and its crucial relationship with the hypothalamus, which controls its activity.

## Hypothalamus:

*   Neuroendocrine organ linking the nervous and endocrine systems.
*   Controls the release of hormones from the pituitary gland via releasing and inhibiting hormones.
*   Synthesizes two hormones (ADH and oxytocin) that are stored in and released from the posterior pituitary.

## Pituitary Gland:

*   Located at the base of the brain, connected to the hypothalamus by the infundibulum.
*   Consists of two major lobes with different origins and functions:
    1.  **Posterior Pituitary (Neurohypophysis):**
        *   Composed largely of neural tissue (axons of hypothalamic neurons).
        *   **Does not synthesize hormones.** Stores and releases two neurohormones made by the hypothalamus:
            *   **Oxytocin:** Stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth and milk ejection during breastfeeding. Also involved in bonding and sexual arousal. Uses PIP2-calcium second messenger. Release stimulated by neural reflexes (e.g., cervical/uterine stretching, suckling). Positive feedback mechanism during labor/nursing.
            *   **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) / Vasopressin:** Inhibits urine formation by causing kidney tubules to reabsorb more water. Helps regulate water balance and blood pressure. Release stimulated by increased blood solute concentration (detected by osmoreceptors in hypothalamus) or decreased blood volume/pressure. Inhibited by adequate hydration, alcohol. Uses cAMP second messenger. High concentrations cause vasoconstriction (vasopressin effect).
    2.  **Anterior Pituitary (Adenohypophysis):**
        *   Composed of glandular tissue. Manufactures and releases six major hormones.
        *   Activity controlled by releasing and inhibiting hormones from the hypothalamus, delivered via the **hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system** (capillary beds connected by portal veins).
        *   **Hormones (most are tropic hormones - regulate other endocrine glands):**
            *   **Growth Hormone (GH):** Stimulates body growth, primarily by acting on liver to produce insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which promote bone and skeletal muscle growth. Also has metabolic effects (mobilizes fats, spares glucose). Release regulated by GHRH (releasing) and GHIH (inhibiting/somatostatin) from hypothalamus.
            *   **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) / Thyrotropin:** Stimulates thyroid gland development and secretion of thyroid hormones. Release regulated by TRH from hypothalamus; inhibited by feedback from thyroid hormones.
            *   **Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) / Corticotropin:** Stimulates adrenal cortex to release corticosteroids (especially glucocorticoids like cortisol). Release regulated by CRH from hypothalamus; inhibited by feedback from glucocorticoids.
            *   **Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH):** Gonadotropin. Stimulates gamete (sperm/egg) production. Release regulated by GnRH from hypothalamus; inhibited by feedback from gonadal hormones.
            *   **Luteinizing Hormone (LH):** Gonadotropin. Promotes production of gonadal hormones (estrogen/testosterone). Triggers ovulation in females. Release regulated by GnRH; inhibited by feedback from gonadal hormones.
            *   **Prolactin (PRL):** Stimulates milk production by breasts. Release primarily controlled by inhibitory hormone PIH (dopamine) from hypothalamus. Levels rise toward end of pregnancy; suckling stimulates release.

The hypothalamus-pituitary axis forms a critical link integrating neural and endocrine control of many body functions.

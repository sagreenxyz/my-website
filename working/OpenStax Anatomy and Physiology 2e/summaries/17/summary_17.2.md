# Summary: 17.2 Hormones

This section details the chemical nature of hormones, their mechanisms of action, how their release is regulated, and how they interact.

## Chemical Classification:

*   **Amino Acid-Based Hormones:** Most common type. Vary in size from simple modified amino acids (e.g., epinephrine, thyroxine) to peptides (e.g., ADH, oxytocin) and proteins (e.g., insulin, growth hormone). Generally water-soluble (except thyroid hormone). Cannot cross plasma membrane easily.
*   **Steroid Hormones:** Synthesized from cholesterol. Include gonadal hormones (estrogen, testosterone) and adrenocortical hormones (cortisol, aldosterone). Lipid-soluble. Can cross plasma membrane easily.

## Mechanisms of Hormone Action:

*   Hormones influence target cells by binding to specific receptors. Receptor location depends on hormone type.
*   **Water-Soluble Hormones (Amino Acid-Based, except Thyroid Hormone):**
    *   Act on receptors *on the plasma membrane*.
    *   Utilize **second messenger systems** (e.g., cyclic AMP (cAMP), PIP2-calcium).
    *   Binding of hormone (first messenger) to receptor activates a G protein -> G protein activates/inhibits an effector enzyme (e.g., adenylate cyclase) -> enzyme generates second messenger (e.g., cAMP) -> second messenger activates protein kinases -> kinases phosphorylate proteins, altering cell activity.
    *   Allows for signal amplification.
*   **Lipid-Soluble Hormones (Steroids and Thyroid Hormone):**
    *   Act on receptors *inside the cell* (cytoplasm or nucleus).
    *   Hormone diffuses through plasma membrane -> binds to intracellular receptor -> activated receptor-hormone complex binds to specific DNA regions (hormone response elements) -> initiates transcription of certain genes -> mRNA is translated into proteins -> proteins alter cell activity.
    *   Direct gene activation; slower but more sustained response.

## Target Cell Specificity & Response:

*   Target cells must have specific receptors for a hormone.
*   Response depends on receptor type and intracellular pathways activated.
*   Factors influencing response: hormone blood levels, number of receptors, affinity of binding.
    *   **Up-regulation:** Target cells form more receptors in response to low hormone levels.
    *   **Down-regulation:** Target cells lose receptors in response to high hormone levels (desensitization).

## Control of Hormone Release:

*   Typically regulated by negative feedback loops. Stimulus triggers hormone release; rising hormone levels inhibit further release.
*   **Types of Stimuli:**
    1.  **Humoral Stimuli:** Changing blood levels of ions or nutrients directly stimulate hormone release (e.g., low blood Ca2+ stimulates PTH release).
    2.  **Neural Stimuli:** Nerve fibers stimulate hormone release (e.g., sympathetic stimulation of adrenal medulla to release catecholamines).
    3.  **Hormonal Stimuli:** Hormones stimulate other endocrine glands to release their hormones (tropic hormones; e.g., hypothalamic hormones stimulate anterior pituitary; pituitary hormones stimulate thyroid, adrenal cortex, gonads).

## Hormone Interactions:

*   Multiple hormones can act on the same target cell.
*   **Permissiveness:** One hormone cannot exert its full effect without another hormone being present (e.g., thyroid hormone needed for reproductive hormones to work fully).
*   **Synergism:** More than one hormone produces the same effects; combined effects are amplified (e.g., glucagon and epinephrine both raise blood glucose).
*   **Antagonism:** One hormone opposes the action of another (e.g., insulin lowers blood glucose, glucagon raises it).

## Hormone Transport and Clearance:

*   Water-soluble hormones circulate freely in blood. Lipid-soluble hormones circulate bound to plasma proteins.
*   Hormones are degraded by enzymes (in target cells or blood/liver) or excreted by kidneys. Half-life varies.

# Summary: 17.10 Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions

This section highlights organs whose primary role is not endocrine, but which contain cells or tissues that produce important hormones.

## Heart:

*   **Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP):** Produced by specialized cardiac muscle cells in the atria in response to high blood pressure/volume (atrial stretch).
    *   **Function:** Reduces blood volume and blood pressure by inhibiting Na+ reabsorption in the kidneys (promoting Na+ and water excretion), suppressing ADH and aldosterone release, and causing vasodilation.

## Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract:

*   Enteroendocrine cells scattered in the mucosa of the stomach and small intestine secrete various peptide hormones that regulate digestive processes.
    *   **Gastrin:** Stimulates HCl secretion by stomach.
    *   **Secretin:** Stimulates bicarbonate secretion by pancreas and bile production by liver.
    *   **Cholecystokinin (CCK):** Stimulates pancreatic enzyme release, gallbladder contraction, and satiety.
    *   **Ghrelin:** Stimulates appetite (from stomach).
    *   **Incretins (e.g., GLP-1, GIP):** Enhance insulin release in response to glucose (from small intestine).

## Kidneys:

*   **Erythropoietin (EPO):** Glycoprotein hormone released in response to hypoxia (low blood oxygen).
    *   **Function:** Stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow.
*   **Renin:** Enzyme that initiates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in response to low blood pressure, leading to aldosterone release and vasoconstriction. (Acts as an enzyme, not a classical hormone, but part of an endocrine pathway).
*   **Calcitriol:** Active form of vitamin D, synthesized in a process involving skin, liver, and kidneys. Promotes calcium absorption from the intestine. (Kidney performs final activation step).

## Skeleton (Osteoblasts):

*   **Osteocalcin:** Hormone produced by osteoblasts.
    *   **Function:** Appears to increase insulin secretion and sensitivity, influence fat deposition, and potentially affect testosterone production. Links bone remodeling to energy metabolism.

## Skin:

*   **Cholecalciferol:** Produces an inactive precursor of vitamin D when exposed to UV radiation. This precursor is then modified by the liver and activated by the kidneys (calcitriol).

## Adipose Tissue:

*   Releases several hormones involved in energy balance and metabolism.
    *   **Leptin:** Secreted in proportion to fat stores. Acts on the hypothalamus to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure. Signals satiety.
    *   **Resistin:** Insulin antagonist.
    *   **Adiponectin:** Enhances insulin sensitivity.

## Thymus:

*   Located deep to the sternum. Large in infants/children, shrinks with age.
*   Produces peptide hormones (thymulin, thymopoietins, thymosins).
    *   **Function:** Involved in the normal development and maturation of T lymphocytes (T cells) of the immune system. Primarily acts locally (paracrine).

Many organs beyond the classical endocrine glands contribute to hormonal regulation of diverse physiological processes.

# Summary: 17.11 Development and Aging of the Endocrine System

This section discusses the embryonic origins of endocrine glands and the changes that occur in the endocrine system throughout life, particularly with aging.

## Embryonic Development:

*   Endocrine glands arise from all three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm).
*   **Ectoderm:** Gives rise to adrenal medulla (from neural crest), pituitary gland (posterior from neural ectoderm outgrowth; anterior from oral ectoderm - Rathke's pouch), pineal gland.
*   **Mesoderm:** Gives rise to adrenal cortex, gonads (testes and ovaries).
*   **Endoderm:** Gives rise to thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, pancreas (islets). Forms lining of digestive tract, source of GI enteroendocrine cells.

## Endocrine Function Throughout Life:

*   **Infancy/Childhood:** Hormones are crucial for growth and development (GH, thyroid hormones). Thymus is large and active. Gonadal hormones low until puberty.
*   **Puberty:** Gonadotropin levels rise, activating gonads to produce sex hormones. Sex hormones drive development of secondary sex characteristics and reproductive system maturation. GH levels also peak.
*   **Adulthood:** Hormone levels generally remain relatively stable, although stress and reproductive cycles cause fluctuations.
*   **Pregnancy:** Significant hormonal changes orchestrated by placental hormones (hCG, estrogen, progesterone, hPL).

## Aging and the Endocrine System:

*   Most endocrine glands show structural changes (e.g., fibrosis, vascular changes) with age, but hormone secretion often remains adequate. Some changes are common:
*   **Growth Hormone (GH):** Levels decline ("somatopause"), contributing to muscle mass loss and increased body fat.
*   **Thyroid Hormone:** Gland may become more nodular. Minor decline in TSH/TH possible, but overt hypothyroidism increases with age. Metabolic rate may decrease.
*   **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH):** Levels tend to remain stable or increase slightly. Bone density often decreases (osteoporosis), influenced by PTH, calcitonin, and sex hormone changes.
*   **Adrenal Glands:** Cortex shows some structural changes, but cortisol/aldosterone output usually adequate. Response to stress may be slower. DHEA levels decline significantly. Medulla function generally unchanged.
*   **Pancreas:** Glucose tolerance tends to decrease with age. Increased incidence of type 2 diabetes, likely due to reduced insulin sensitivity and potentially slightly impaired beta cell function.
*   **Gonads:**
    *   **Ovaries:** Undergo significant changes with menopause. Estrogen production ceases, leading to atrophy of reproductive organs, bone density loss, cardiovascular changes, hot flashes. FSH/LH levels rise due to lack of feedback.
    *   **Testes:** Testosterone production declines gradually ("andropause"), but typically remains sufficient for reproductive function in older men. Effects are less dramatic than menopause.
*   **Pineal Gland:** Melatonin production may decline, potentially contributing to sleep pattern changes.
*   **Thymus:** Shrinks significantly after puberty (involution), leading to decline in T cell production and immune function.

While aging affects endocrine function, many changes are gradual, and significant endocrine disease is not an inevitable part of aging, although the incidence of some disorders (e.g., type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism) increases. Exposure to environmental pollutants may also disrupt endocrine function over time.

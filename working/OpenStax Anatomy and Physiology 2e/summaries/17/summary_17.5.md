# Summary: 17.5 The Parathyroid Glands

This section describes the parathyroid glands and their crucial role in calcium homeostasis through the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH).

## Anatomy and Location:

*   Small, typically four (can vary) glands located on the posterior aspect of the thyroid gland.
*   Contain chief cells (secrete PTH) and oxyphil cells (function unclear).

## Parathyroid Hormone (PTH):

*   **Function:** The single most important hormone controlling calcium balance in the blood. Increases blood Ca2+ levels. Essential for life.
*   **Regulation:** Released in response to low blood Ca2+ levels (humoral stimulus). Inhibited by high blood Ca2+ levels.
*   **Target Organs and Effects:**
    1.  **Skeleton:** Stimulates osteoclasts to digest bone matrix and release Ca2+ and phosphates into the blood.
    2.  **Kidneys:** Enhances reabsorption of Ca2+ from filtrate back into blood. Promotes excretion of phosphate. Activates vitamin D into its active form, calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3).
    3.  **Intestine:** Indirectly increases absorption of Ca2+ from food by activating vitamin D (calcitriol is required for Ca2+ absorption in the intestines).

## Calcium Homeostasis:

*   PTH and calcitonin (from thyroid) have antagonistic effects, but PTH is the primary regulator.
*   Precise control of extracellular Ca2+ is critical for nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, blood clotting, cell division, and enzyme activity.
*   **Hyperparathyroidism:** Excess PTH. Causes hypercalcemia (high blood Ca2+), leading to bone softening (osteitis fibrosa cystica), kidney stones, depressed nervous system function, muscle weakness.
*   **Hypoparathyroidism:** PTH deficiency. Causes hypocalcemia (low blood Ca2+), leading to increased neuron excitability, muscle twitches, tetany, convulsions. Can cause respiratory paralysis and death if untreated.

The parathyroid glands, through PTH secretion, are essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis by acting on bone, kidneys, and indirectly on the intestine.

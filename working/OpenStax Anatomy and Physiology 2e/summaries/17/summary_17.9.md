# Summary: 17.9 The Endocrine Pancreas

This section describes the endocrine functions of the pancreas, focusing on the hormones produced by the pancreatic islets (islets of Langerhans) that regulate blood glucose levels.

## Anatomy and Location:

*   Located partially behind the stomach in the abdomen.
*   Mixed gland with both exocrine (acinar cells producing digestive enzymes) and endocrine functions.
*   **Pancreatic Islets (Islets of Langerhans):** Clusters of endocrine cells scattered among the acinar tissue. Contain different cell types producing distinct hormones.

## Islet Cell Types and Hormones:

*   **Alpha (α) Cells:** Produce **Glucagon**.
*   **Beta (β) Cells:** Produce **Insulin** (most abundant islet cell).
*   **Delta (δ) Cells:** Produce **Somatostatin**.
*   **PP Cells (F cells):** Produce **Pancreatic Polypeptide**.

## Regulation of Blood Glucose:

*   Glucagon and insulin are the primary hormones regulating blood glucose, acting antagonistically.

### Glucagon:

*   **Function:** Hyperglycemic hormone; increases blood glucose levels.
*   **Target Organ:** Primarily the liver.
*   **Effects:**
    *   Stimulates **glycogenolysis** (breakdown of glycogen to glucose).
    *   Stimulates **gluconeogenesis** (synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources like lactic acid and amino acids).
    *   Stimulates release of glucose into the blood by liver cells.
*   **Regulation:** Release stimulated by low blood glucose levels (humoral stimulus), sympathetic nervous system activation, and rising amino acid levels (e.g., after protein-rich meal). Inhibited by high blood glucose and somatostatin.

### Insulin:

*   **Function:** Hypoglycemic hormone; lowers blood glucose levels.
*   **Target Organs:** Most body cells, especially liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue. (Brain, kidney, liver access glucose without insulin).
*   **Effects:**
    *   Enhances membrane transport of glucose *into* most body cells (especially muscle and fat cells).
    *   Inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver.
    *   Promotes **glycogenesis** (synthesis of glycogen) in liver and muscle.
    *   Promotes conversion of glucose to fat in adipose tissue.
    *   Increases amino acid uptake and protein synthesis.
*   **Regulation:** Release stimulated by high blood glucose levels (humoral stimulus), rising blood levels of amino acids and fatty acids, and parasympathetic nervous system activation (ACh). Inhibited by low blood glucose, sympathetic activation (indirectly), and somatostatin.

### Somatostatin:

*   Also released by hypothalamus (GHIH).
*   Inhibits release of both insulin and glucagon from neighboring islet cells.
*   May slow gastrointestinal activity and nutrient absorption.

### Pancreatic Polypeptide:

*   Released after meals; may regulate pancreatic exocrine secretion and GI motility.

## Diabetes Mellitus:

*   Disorder characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) due to hyposecretion or hypoactivity of insulin.
*   **Type 1:** Autoimmune destruction of beta cells; absolute insulin deficiency. Requires insulin therapy.
*   **Type 2:** Insulin resistance (target cells respond poorly) combined with relative insulin deficiency. Often associated with obesity. Managed with lifestyle changes, oral medications, sometimes insulin.
*   **Consequences:** Lack of insulin means glucose cannot enter cells, leading to high blood glucose, glucose in urine (glycosuria), increased urination (polyuria), thirst (polydipsia), hunger (polyphagia). Body breaks down fats for energy, leading to ketone body formation (ketoacidosis). Long-term complications affect blood vessels, nerves, kidneys, eyes.

The endocrine pancreas plays a vital role in fuel metabolism, primarily through the opposing actions of glucagon and insulin on blood glucose levels.

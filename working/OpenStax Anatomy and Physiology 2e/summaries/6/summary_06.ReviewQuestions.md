# Summary: Chapter 6 Review Questions

This section contains review questions designed to test comprehension of the key concepts covered in Chapter 6 regarding bone tissue and the skeletal system. The questions likely cover topics such as:

*   Functions of the skeletal system.
*   Classification of bones based on shape.
*   Gross anatomy of long bones (diaphysis, epiphysis, membranes).
*   Histology of compact and spongy bone (osteons, trabeculae, cell types).
*   Bone formation processes (intramembranous and endochondral ossification).
*   Bone growth (longitudinal and appositional).
*   Bone remodeling and factors affecting it (hormones, mechanical stress).
*   Calcium homeostasis (roles of PTH, calcitonin).
*   Fracture types and the process of bone repair.
*   Factors influencing bone health: exercise (Wolff's Law), nutrition (calcium, vitamin D), hormones (GH, PTH, calcitonin, sex hormones), and calcium homeostasis.

## Check Your Understanding

1.  For each of the key topics listed above (functions, classification, structure, formation, repair, influencing factors), formulate one specific question that tests deeper understanding beyond a simple definition.
2.  Choose one type of bone cell and describe how its structure relates to its function.
3.  Explain the importance of calcium homeostasis for the body, beyond just bone health.

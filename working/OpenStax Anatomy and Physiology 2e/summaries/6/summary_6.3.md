# Summary: 6.3 Bone Structure

This section details the macroscopic (gross) and microscopic anatomy of bone tissue.

*   **Gross Anatomy of a Long Bone:**
    *   **Diaphysis:** The shaft or main long part of the bone. Composed primarily of compact bone surrounding a central medullary cavity.
    *   **Epiphysis (plural: Epiphyses):** The expanded ends of the bone. Consist of spongy bone internally, covered by a thin layer of compact bone externally. Articular surfaces are covered with hyaline (articular) cartilage.
    *   **Metaphysis:** The region where the diaphysis joins the epiphysis. In growing bone, it contains the epiphyseal plate (hyaline cartilage). In adult bone, it contains the epiphyseal line (remnant of the plate).
    *   **Periosteum:** A double-layered membrane covering the external surface of the bone (except at articular surfaces).
        *   **Outer Fibrous Layer:** Dense irregular connective tissue; attachment site for tendons and ligaments.
        *   **Inner Osteogenic Layer:** Contains osteoprogenitor cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts; involved in bone growth, repair, and remodeling.
        *   Richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels (enter bone via nutrient foramina). Secured to bone by Sharpey's fibers (perforating fibers).
    *   **Endosteum:** A thin membrane lining the internal bone surfaces: medullary cavity, trabeculae of spongy bone, and canals of compact bone. Contains osteoprogenitor cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts.
    *   **Medullary Cavity:** Central cavity within the diaphysis. Contains yellow bone marrow (fat) in adults; contains red bone marrow (hematopoiesis) in infants and children.
    *   **Articular Cartilage:** Hyaline cartilage covering the epiphyses where bones articulate; reduces friction and absorbs shock.
*   **Microscopic Anatomy of Bone Tissue:**
    *   **Compact Bone (Dense/Cortical Bone):**
        *   Forms the dense outer layer of bones; provides strength and protection.
        *   Structural unit is the **Osteon (Haversian System):** Elongated cylinder parallel to the long axis of the bone.
        *   **Components of an Osteon:**
            *   **Lamellae:** Concentric rings of calcified bone matrix surrounding the central canal. Collagen fibers in adjacent lamellae run in different directions, resisting twisting forces.
            *   **Central Canal (Haversian Canal):** Runs through the core of each osteon; contains blood vessels and nerves.
            *   **Lacunae:** Small spaces between lamellae containing osteocytes.
            *   **Osteocytes:** Mature bone cells residing in lacunae; maintain the bone matrix.
            *   **Canaliculi:** Hair-like canals connecting lacunae to each other and to the central canal; allow nutrient/waste exchange for osteocytes via gap junctions.
        *   **Other Features:**
            *   **Perforating Canals (Volkmann's Canals):** Run perpendicular to central canals; connect blood/nerve supply of periosteum, central canals, and medullary cavity.
            *   **Interstitial Lamellae:** Fill gaps between forming osteons or are remnants of remodeled osteons.
            *   **Circumferential Lamellae:** Extend around the entire circumference of the diaphysis (deep to periosteum and superficial to endosteum).
    *   **Spongy Bone (Cancellous/Trabecular Bone):**
        *   Internal layer, found in epiphyses of long bones, lining medullary cavity, and making up diploe of flat bones.
        *   Consists of a honeycomb network of small, needle-like or flat pieces called **trabeculae**.
        *   Open spaces between trabeculae are filled with red or yellow bone marrow.
        *   Trabeculae align along lines of stress, providing strength with less weight.
        *   Lamellae, osteocytes, and canaliculi are present, but osteons are typically absent. Nutrients reach osteocytes by diffusion from marrow spaces via canaliculi.
*   **Bone Cells:**
    *   **Osteoprogenitor Cells (Osteogenic Cells):** Stem cells found in periosteum and endosteum; differentiate into osteoblasts.
    *   **Osteoblasts:** Bone-forming cells; secrete osteoid (unmineralized matrix); initiate calcification. Become osteocytes when trapped in matrix.
    *   **Osteocytes:** Mature bone cells trapped in lacunae; maintain bone matrix; act as stress sensors.
    *   **Osteoclasts:** Large, multinucleated cells responsible for bone resorption (breakdown); derived from hematopoietic stem cells. Secrete acids and enzymes to dissolve matrix. Found in resorption bays (Howship's lacunae).
*   **Chemical Composition:**
    *   **Organic Components (approx. 35%):** Cells and osteoid (collagen fibers, ground substance). Provide flexibility and tensile strength.
    *   **Inorganic Components (approx. 65%):** Hydroxyapatite (mineral salts, primarily calcium phosphate). Provide hardness and resistance to compression.
*   **Blood and Nerve Supply:** Bone is well vascularized and innervated. Nutrient arteries enter via nutrient foramina. Nerves accompany blood vessels, especially in the periosteum (source of pain in fractures).

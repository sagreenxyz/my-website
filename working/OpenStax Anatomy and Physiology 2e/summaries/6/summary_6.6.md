# Summary: 6.6 Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones, and Bone Tissue

This section explores the various factors that influence bone health, including mechanical stress, dietary intake, and hormonal regulation.

*   **Mechanical Stress (Exercise):**
    *   Bone adapts to the loads placed upon it (Wolff's Law).
    *   Weight-bearing exercise (walking, running, weightlifting) stimulates osteoblasts, leading to increased bone density and strength.
    *   Lack of mechanical stress (e.g., prolonged bed rest, immobilization, space travel) leads to bone loss (decreased density) due to reduced osteoblast activity and relatively unopposed osteoclast activity.
*   **Nutrition:**
    *   **Calcium:** Essential component of hydroxyapatite (bone mineral). Required for bone matrix formation and mineralization. Obtained from dairy products, leafy greens, fortified foods.
    *   **Vitamin D:** Necessary for calcium absorption from the small intestine. Synthesized in the skin with UV exposure or obtained from diet (fortified milk, fatty fish). Deficiency leads to poor calcium absorption and bone diseases (rickets in children, osteomalacia in adults).
    *   **Vitamin K:** Supports bone mineralization; may play a role in regulating osteocalcin activity (a bone protein). Found in green leafy vegetables.
    *   **Magnesium:** Structural component of bone; required for osteoblast activity.
    *   **Fluoride:** Can incorporate into hydroxyapatite, increasing bone density and resistance to decay (primarily relevant for teeth, but also bone).
    *   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** May reduce inflammation and enhance bone formation. Found in fatty fish.
    *   **Protein:** Provides the collagen framework for bone matrix.
*   **Hormones:**
    *   **Growth Hormone (GH):** Secreted by the pituitary gland. Stimulates chondrocyte proliferation at the epiphyseal plate, promoting bone lengthening. Also enhances bone density by stimulating osteoblasts.
    *   **Thyroxine (Thyroid Hormone):** Secreted by the thyroid gland. Promotes bone growth (synergistic with GH) and skeletal maturation. Regulates osteoblast/osteoclast activity.
    *   **Sex Hormones (Estrogen and Testosterone):**
        *   Promote bone growth and epiphyseal plate closure during puberty (growth spurt).
        *   Maintain bone mass throughout adulthood by restraining osteoclast activity and promoting osteoblast activity.
        *   Estrogen decline after menopause is a major cause of osteoporosis in women.
    *   **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH):** Primarily regulates blood calcium; stimulates osteoclast activity (bone resorption) when blood calcium is low.
    *   **Calcitonin:** Primarily regulates blood calcium; inhibits osteoclast activity when blood calcium is high (less significant role in adults).
    *   **Glucocorticoids (e.g., Cortisol):** High levels (e.g., stress, medication) inhibit osteoblasts and increase bone resorption, leading to bone loss.

Bone health is dynamic, influenced by mechanical stress, nutrition, and hormonal regulation, particularly concerning calcium homeostasis.

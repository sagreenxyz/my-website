# Summary: 6.5 Fractures: Bone Repair

This section discusses different types of bone fractures and the physiological process of bone repair.

*   **Fracture Definition:** A break in a bone.
*   **Types of Fractures (Classification):**
    *   **Based on Skin Integrity:**
        *   **Closed (Simple) Fracture:** The skin remains intact over the fracture site.
        *   **Open (Compound) Fracture:** The broken bone end(s) penetrate the skin; risk of infection is high.
    *   **Based on Fracture Pattern/Line:**
        *   **Transverse Fracture:** Occurs straight across the long axis of the bone.
        *   **Oblique Fracture:** Occurs at an angle that is not 90 degrees to the long axis.
        *   **Spiral Fracture:** Bone segments are pulled apart due to a twisting motion. Common in sports injuries.
        *   **Comminuted Fracture:** Several breaks result in many small pieces between the main segments.
        *   **Impacted Fracture:** One fragment is driven firmly into the other, usually as a result of compression.
        *   **Greenstick Fracture:** An incomplete fracture where only one side of the bone breaks (like breaking a green twig); common in children whose bones are more flexible.
    *   **Other Types:**
        *   **Colles' Fracture:** Fracture of the distal radius (wrist).
        *   **Pott's Fracture:** Fracture of the distal fibula and often the tibial malleolus (ankle).
*   **Bone Repair Process:** Involves four overlapping stages:
    1.  **Hematoma Formation (Inflammatory Stage):**
        *   Blood vessels in the broken bone tear, forming a blood clot (fracture hematoma) at the site.
        *   Bone cells deprived of nutrients die.
        *   Inflammation occurs: swelling, pain, recruitment of immune cells to clear debris.
        *   Typically lasts several days.
    2.  **Fibrocartilaginous Callus Formation (Repair Stage):**
        *   Capillaries grow into the hematoma; phagocytic cells clear debris.
        *   Fibroblasts produce collagen fibers connecting the broken ends.
        *   Chondroblasts secrete a cartilaginous matrix.
        *   This mass of repair tissue, containing collagen fibers and cartilage, is called the fibrocartilaginous callus (soft callus).
        *   Splints the bone internally.
        *   Lasts about 3-4 weeks.
    3.  **Bony Callus Formation (Repair Stage):**
        *   Osteoprogenitor cells differentiate into osteoblasts within the callus.
        *   Osteoblasts begin to produce spongy bone (trabeculae), converting the fibrocartilaginous callus into a bony callus (hard callus).
        *   Process begins 3-4 weeks after injury and continues until a firm union is formed, typically about 2-3 months later.
    4.  **Bone Remodeling:**
        *   The bony callus is gradually remodeled over months or years.
        *   Osteoclasts resorb excess material on the exterior and within the medullary cavity.
        *   Osteoblasts lay down compact bone on the exterior to reconstruct the original shape and strength.
        *   The repaired area may remain slightly thickened.
*   **Factors Affecting Repair:** Age, fracture type/severity, blood supply, nutritional status, immobilization, presence of infection.

Despite their strength, bones can fracture, but they have a remarkable capacity for self-repair.

# Summary: 6.1 The Functions of the Skeletal System

This section outlines the primary physiological functions performed by the skeletal system.

*   **Support:**
    *   Provides a rigid framework that supports the weight of the body.
    *   Gives shape to the body.
    *   Supports soft tissues and organs.
*   **Protection:**
    *   Forms protective casings around vital organs.
    *   Examples: Skull protects the brain, vertebral column protects the spinal cord, thoracic cage (ribs and sternum) protects the heart and lungs.
*   **Movement:**
    *   Bones act as levers, and joints act as fulcrums (pivot points).
    *   Skeletal muscles attach to bones via tendons. When muscles contract, they pull on bones to produce movement.
*   **Mineral Storage and Homeostasis:**
    *   Bones serve as the body's primary reservoir for minerals, especially calcium and phosphorus.
    *   These minerals can be released from bone into the bloodstream as needed to maintain critical mineral ion concentrations (homeostasis) required for physiological processes like muscle contraction and nerve function.
*   **Blood Cell Formation (Hematopoiesis):**
    *   Red bone marrow, located within the cavities of certain bones (e.g., spongy bone of flat bones, epiphyses of long bones like femur and humerus), is the site of production for red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
*   **Triglyceride (Fat) Storage:**
    *   Yellow bone marrow, found in the medullary cavities of long bones in adults, consists primarily of adipose tissue and serves as a source of stored energy (triglycerides).

The skeletal system provides the internal framework of the body, crucial for survival and movement.

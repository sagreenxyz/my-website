# Summary: 6.7 Calcium Homeostasis: Interactions of the Skeletal System and Other Organ Systems

This section explains the critical role of the skeletal system in maintaining calcium homeostasis and its interaction with endocrine, digestive, and urinary systems.

*   **Importance of Calcium:** Calcium is essential for numerous physiological processes, including:
    *   Bone mineralization (hardness).
    *   Muscle contraction.
    *   Nerve impulse transmission.
    *   Blood clotting.
    *   Enzyme activity.
*   **Skeletal System as Calcium Reservoir:** Bones act as the body's primary storage site for calcium (and phosphate). About 99% of the body's calcium is stored in bones.
*   **Maintaining Blood Calcium Levels:** Blood calcium concentration is tightly regulated within a narrow range (around 10 mg/dL). Deviations can cause significant health problems (hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia).
*   **Hormonal Regulation:** Three main hormones regulate blood calcium levels by influencing bone activity (osteoclasts and osteoblasts), intestinal absorption, and kidney excretion:
    *   **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH):**
        *   Secreted by the parathyroid glands in response to **low** blood calcium levels.
        *   **Actions:**
            *   Stimulates osteoclast activity (bone resorption), releasing calcium into the blood.
            *   Increases calcium reabsorption by the kidneys (less calcium lost in urine).
            *   Stimulates the synthesis of calcitriol (active Vitamin D) by the kidneys.
        *   **Overall Effect:** Increases blood calcium levels.
    *   **Calcitriol (Active Vitamin D):**
        *   Steroid hormone derived from Vitamin D3 (synthesized in skin or obtained from diet). Activation requires steps in the liver and kidneys (final step stimulated by PTH).
        *   **Actions:**
            *   Increases calcium (and phosphate) absorption from the small intestine.
            *   Works with PTH to stimulate bone resorption (at high levels).
            *   Slightly increases calcium reabsorption by kidneys.
        *   **Overall Effect:** Increases blood calcium levels.
    *   **Calcitonin:**
        *   Secreted by the parafollicular (C) cells of the thyroid gland in response to **high** blood calcium levels.
        *   **Actions:**
            *   Inhibits osteoclast activity (decreases bone resorption).
            *   May stimulate osteoblast activity (calcium deposition into bone).
            *   Increases calcium excretion by the kidneys (more calcium lost in urine).
        *   **Overall Effect:** Decreases blood calcium levels (role in adults is less significant than PTH/Calcitriol).
*   **Feedback Loop:** Blood calcium levels control the secretion of PTH and calcitonin via negative feedback mechanisms, ensuring homeostasis.
*   **Interactions with Other Systems:**
    *   **Endocrine System:** Produces PTH, calcitonin, calcitriol.
    *   **Digestive System:** Absorbs dietary calcium (influenced by calcitriol).
    *   **Urinary System:** Excretes or reabsorbs calcium from filtrate (influenced by PTH and calcitonin).
    *   **Integumentary System:** Synthesizes precursor Vitamin D3 upon UV exposure.

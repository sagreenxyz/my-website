# Summary: 12.3 The Function of Nervous Tissue

This section explains the electrical properties of neurons that allow them to communicate, focusing on membrane potentials.

## Basic Principles of Electricity:

*   **Voltage (V):** Measure of potential energy generated by separated electrical charges (ions). Measured in millivolts (mV) in the body. Potential difference or potential.
*   **Current (I):** Flow of electrical charge from one point to another. Depends on voltage and resistance. In the body, current is the flow of ions.
*   **Resistance (R):** Hindrance to charge flow provided by substances the current must pass through. Plasma membrane provides resistance.
*   **Ohm's Law:** Current (I) = Voltage (V) / Resistance (R). Current is directly proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to resistance.

## Role of Membrane Ion Channels:

*   Plasma membranes contain ion channels, selective protein pores allowing specific ions to pass.
*   **Leakage (Nongated) Channels:** Always open. Contribute to resting membrane potential.
*   **Gated Channels:** Open or close in response to specific signals.
    *   **Chemically Gated (Ligand-Gated):** Open when a specific chemical (neurotransmitter) binds. Found on dendrites and cell bodies. Mediate graded potentials.
    *   **Voltage-Gated:** Open/close in response to changes in membrane potential. Found on axons. Mediate action potentials.
    *   **Mechanically Gated:** Open in response to physical deformation (sensory receptors).

## Resting Membrane Potential (RMP):

*   The voltage difference across the plasma membrane of a resting neuron (typically -70mV). The inside is negative relative to the outside. Polarized state.
*   **Generated by:**
    1.  **Differences in Ionic Composition:** Higher concentration of Na+ outside; higher concentration of K+ inside. Negatively charged proteins (A-) trapped inside.
    2.  **Differences in Plasma Membrane Permeability:** Membrane is much more permeable to K+ than Na+ at rest (due to more K+ leakage channels). K+ diffuses out down its concentration gradient, making the inside more negative. Na+ trickles in slowly.
    3.  **Sodium-Potassium Pump (Na+/K+ ATPase):** Actively transports 3 Na+ ions *out* for every 2 K+ ions *in*. Stabilizes the RMP by maintaining the concentration gradients established by ion leakage.

## Membrane Potential Changes (Signals):

*   Neurons use changes in membrane potential as communication signals. Caused by changes in membrane permeability to ions.
*   **Graded Potentials:** Short-lived, localized changes in membrane potential (depolarization or hyperpolarization). Magnitude varies with stimulus strength. Decay with distance. Occur on dendrites/cell bodies.
*   **Action Potentials (Nerve Impulses):** Brief, large, long-distance reversals of membrane potential (-70mV to +30mV). All-or-none events. Do not decay with distance. Occur on axons.

Understanding membrane potentials is key to understanding how neurons generate and transmit signals.

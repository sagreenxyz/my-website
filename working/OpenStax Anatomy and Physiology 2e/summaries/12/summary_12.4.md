# Summary: 12.4 The Action Potential

This section details the generation, propagation, and characteristics of action potentials (APs), the principal way neurons send signals over long distances.

## Generation of an Action Potential:

*   Occurs in excitable membranes (axons of neurons, muscle cells). Requires voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Resting State:** All voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels are closed. RMP is maintained.
    2.  **Depolarization:** A stimulus (often summed graded potentials reaching the axon hillock) causes the membrane potential to reach **threshold** (typically around -55mV). Voltage-gated Na+ channels open rapidly. Na+ rushes *into* the cell, causing rapid depolarization (membrane potential becomes less negative, then positive, reaching about +30mV).
    3.  **Repolarization:** Voltage-gated Na+ channels inactivate. Voltage-gated K+ channels open slowly. K+ rushes *out* of the cell, restoring negative membrane potential.
    4.  **Hyperpolarization (Undershoot):** K+ channels remain open briefly after repolarization, allowing excessive K+ efflux. Membrane potential becomes more negative than RMP. Na+ channels reset to resting state.
    5.  **Return to Resting State:** Na+/K+ pump restores ionic distributions.

## Threshold and All-or-None Principle:

*   **Threshold:** The critical level of depolarization required to trigger an AP.
*   **All-or-None:** If threshold is reached, an AP is generated with a constant, maximum amplitude. If threshold is not reached, no AP occurs. Stronger stimuli do not produce larger APs.

## Propagation of an Action Potential:

*   AP must be transmitted along the entire axon length.
*   **Mechanism:** Influx of Na+ during depolarization creates local currents that depolarize adjacent membrane segments to threshold, triggering APs sequentially along the axon. AP propagates away from its origin.
*   **Conduction Velocity:** Speed depends on:
    *   **Axon Diameter:** Larger diameter = faster conduction (less resistance to local current flow).
    *   **Degree of Myelination:** Myelinated axons conduct much faster.
        *   **Continuous Conduction:** In unmyelinated axons; slow, APs generated at adjacent sites.
        *   **Saltatory Conduction:** In myelinated axons; APs generated only at nodes of Ranvier. Current flows rapidly under myelin sheath from node to node. Much faster and more energy-efficient.

## Refractory Periods:

*   Period when a neuron cannot generate another AP or requires a stronger stimulus. Ensures one-way propagation and limits firing frequency.
*   **Absolute Refractory Period:** From opening of Na+ channels until they reset. Neuron *cannot* respond to another stimulus.
*   **Relative Refractory Period:** Follows absolute period. Most Na+ channels reset, K+ channels still open (hyperpolarization). Threshold is elevated; only an exceptionally strong stimulus can trigger another AP.

## Stimulus Intensity Coding:

*   Since APs are all-or-none, stimulus intensity is coded by the **frequency** of APs (number of APs per unit time). Stronger stimuli generate APs more frequently.

Action potentials are the fundamental electrical signals for long-distance communication in the nervous system.

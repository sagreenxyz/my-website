# Summary: 12.5 Communication Between Neurons

This section focuses on the synapse, the junction where information is transmitted from one neuron to the next, or from a neuron to an effector cell.

## The Synapse:

*   **Presynaptic Neuron:** Neuron transmitting the signal towards the synapse.
*   **Postsynaptic Neuron:** Neuron receiving the signal away from the synapse.
*   **Types of Synapses:**
    *   **Axodendritic:** Axon terminal to dendrite (most common).
    *   **Axosomatic:** Axon terminal to cell body.
    *   **Axoaxonic:** Axon terminal to axon.

## Electrical Synapses:

*   Less common. Neurons joined by gap junctions, allowing direct flow of ions between cells.
*   Provide rapid, synchronized transmission (e.g., in some brain regions responsible for stereotyped movements, also found in cardiac and smooth muscle).

## Chemical Synapses:

*   Most common type. Use chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) to transmit signals.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Axon Terminal (Presynaptic):** Contains synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitters. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels present.
    *   **Synaptic Cleft:** Fluid-filled space separating presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes.
    *   **Postsynaptic Membrane:** Contains receptors (chemically gated ion channels) specific for the neurotransmitter.
*   **Information Transfer:**
    1.  Action potential arrives at axon terminal.
    2.  Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open; Ca2+ enters the terminal.
    3.  Ca2+ influx triggers exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, releasing neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft.
    4.  Neurotransmitter diffuses across the cleft and binds to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.
    5.  Binding opens chemically gated ion channels, causing a **graded potential** in the postsynaptic neuron.
    6.  Neurotransmitter effects are terminated (reuptake, degradation, diffusion).

## Postsynaptic Potentials (Graded Potentials):

*   **Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP):**
    *   Neurotransmitter binding causes depolarization (e.g., opening Na+ channels).
    *   Makes the postsynaptic neuron *more likely* to reach threshold and fire an AP.
*   **Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP):**
    *   Neurotransmitter binding causes hyperpolarization (e.g., opening K+ or Cl- channels).
    *   Makes the postsynaptic neuron *less likely* to reach threshold.

## Synaptic Integration: Summation:

*   A single EPSP is usually too small to trigger an AP. Postsynaptic neuron integrates multiple inputs.
*   **Temporal Summation:** Rapid firing of one or more presynaptic neurons releases neurotransmitter repeatedly, summing effects over time.
*   **Spatial Summation:** Postsynaptic neuron stimulated simultaneously by multiple presynaptic terminals at different locations. Large numbers of EPSPs can summate to reach threshold. IPSPs can also summate, counteracting EPSPs.
*   The axon hillock acts as the integrator; if summed potentials reach threshold, an AP is generated.

## Neurotransmitters:

*   Chemical messengers released by neurons. Over 50 identified.
*   **Classification by Chemical Structure:** Acetylcholine, biogenic amines (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin), amino acids (GABA, glutamate), peptides (endorphins), purines (ATP), gases (NO).
*   **Classification by Function:**
    *   **Excitatory vs. Inhibitory:** Effect depends on the receptor type on the postsynaptic membrane. (e.g., ACh is excitatory at neuromuscular junction, inhibitory at heart).
    *   **Direct vs. Indirect Action:**
        *   **Direct:** Bind to and open ion channels (rapid).
        *   **Indirect:** Act through second messengers (G protein-linked receptors); slower, longer-lasting effects, modulate cell activity.

Synapses allow for complex information processing through the release, reception, and integration of chemical signals.

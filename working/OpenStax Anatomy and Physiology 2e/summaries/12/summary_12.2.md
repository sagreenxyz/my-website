# Summary: 12.2 Nervous Tissue

This section describes the cellular components of nervous tissue: neurons (nerve cells) and neuroglia (glial cells).

## Neurons:

*   **Function:** Excitable cells that generate and transmit electrical signals (nerve impulses or action potentials). The structural units of the nervous system.
*   **Characteristics:** Extreme longevity, amitotic (mostly lose ability to divide), high metabolic rate (require continuous oxygen and glucose).
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Cell Body (Soma or Perikaryon):** Contains the nucleus and most organelles; biosynthetic center. Clusters in CNS are called nuclei; clusters in PNS are called ganglia.
    *   **Dendrites:** Short, branching extensions; receptive (input) regions; convey incoming signals (graded potentials) *towards* the cell body.
    *   **Axon:** Single long process arising from the axon hillock; conducting region; generates and transmits nerve impulses (action potentials) *away* from the cell body towards terminals. Bundles in CNS are called tracts; bundles in PNS are called nerves.
    *   **Axon Terminals (Synaptic Boutons):** Branched endings of the axon; secretory region; release neurotransmitters to communicate with other neurons or effectors.
    *   **Myelin Sheath:** Segmented, insulating layer surrounding many axons; increases speed of nerve impulse transmission. Formed by Schwann cells (PNS) and oligodendrocytes (CNS). Gaps are called nodes of Ranvier.

## Neuroglia (Glial Cells):

*   **Function:** Non-excitable supporting cells that surround and wrap neurons. Provide physical support, insulation, and nourishment. Outnumber neurons significantly. Can divide throughout life.
*   **Types in CNS:**
    *   **Astrocytes:** Most abundant; support and brace neurons, anchor them to capillaries, control chemical environment (neurotransmitter uptake, ion buffering), guide neuron migration, form part of blood-brain barrier.
    *   **Microglia:** Phagocytic cells; monitor neuron health, engulf microorganisms and debris. Immune cells of the CNS.
    *   **Ependymal Cells:** Line central cavities of brain and spinal cord; circulate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with cilia.
    *   **Oligodendrocytes:** Form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS. One oligodendrocyte can myelinate multiple axons.
*   **Types in PNS:**
    *   **Satellite Cells:** Surround neuron cell bodies within ganglia; function similar to astrocytes (support, regulate environment).
    *   **Schwann Cells (Neurolemmocytes):** Form myelin sheaths around axons in the PNS. One Schwann cell myelinates one segment of an axon. Also vital for regeneration of damaged peripheral nerve fibers.

Nervous tissue comprises highly specialized neurons for signaling and diverse glial cells for support, insulation, and protection.

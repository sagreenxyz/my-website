# Summary: 24.4 Protein Metabolism

This section covers the breakdown, synthesis, and interconversion of proteins and amino acids, emphasizing their roles beyond structure and the handling of nitrogenous waste.

## Protein Synthesis and Breakdown:

*   **Protein Synthesis (Anabolism):**
    *   Amino acids absorbed from digestion or synthesized by the body are used to build proteins.
    *   Occurs on ribosomes, directed by DNA/RNA (transcription and translation).
    *   Requires a complete set of essential amino acids obtained from the diet.
    *   Hormonally controlled (e.g., growth hormone, sex hormones promote synthesis; cortisol promotes breakdown).
    *   Proteins are constantly turned over (synthesized and degraded).
*   **Protein Breakdown (Catabolism):**
    *   Proteins are broken down into amino acids.
    *   Amino acids can be recycled for new protein synthesis or metabolized for energy.

## Amino Acid Metabolism:

*   **Amino Acid Pool:** The body's supply of free amino acids (from diet, tissue breakdown, synthesis). Used for protein synthesis, energy, or conversion to fat/glucose.
*   **Oxidation of Amino Acids (for Energy):** Occurs when dietary protein is in excess or during starvation/fasting when glycogen/fat stores are low.
    *   **Transamination:** An amine group (-NH2) is transferred from an amino acid to an α-keto acid (like α-ketoglutarate), converting the original amino acid into a different α-keto acid and forming glutamate. Catalyzed by transaminases. Reversible.
    *   **Oxidative Deamination:** The amine group of glutamate is removed as ammonia (NH3) in the liver, regenerating α-ketoglutarate. The ammonia is toxic.
    *   **Keto Acid Modification:** The resulting α-keto acid (from transamination or deamination) can be modified to enter metabolic pathways:
        *   Converted to pyruvic acid or intermediates of the Krebs cycle (e.g., acetyl-CoA, α-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate) to be oxidized for ATP.
        *   Converted to glucose (gluconeogenesis) if ATP is sufficient.
        *   Converted to fatty acids for storage.

## Handling of Ammonia (Urea Cycle):

*   **Problem:** Ammonia (NH3) produced during deamination is highly toxic.
*   **Solution:** The liver converts ammonia to **urea**, a less toxic compound.
*   **Urea Cycle:** A series of enzymatic reactions in the liver combining ammonia with CO2 to form urea.
*   **Excretion:** Urea is released into the blood and transported to the kidneys for excretion in urine.

## Nitrogen Balance:

*   **Definition:** The state where the rate of protein synthesis equals the rate of protein breakdown and loss. Nitrogen intake (diet) = Nitrogen output (urine, feces, skin).
*   **Positive Nitrogen Balance:** Synthesis > Breakdown (e.g., growth, pregnancy, tissue repair).
*   **Negative Nitrogen Balance:** Breakdown > Synthesis (e.g., starvation, illness, stress, poor protein intake).

## Check Your Understanding

1.  What are the two main fates of amino acids absorbed from digestion?
2.  Describe the process of transamination in amino acid metabolism.
3.  What happens during oxidative deamination, and what toxic byproduct is formed?
4.  Why is the urea cycle important, and where does it primarily occur?
5.  What does it mean to be in positive nitrogen balance versus negative nitrogen balance?

Proteins serve crucial structural and functional roles. Amino acids can be interconverted, used for synthesis, or oxidized for energy after removal of the amine group, which is detoxified via the urea cycle in the liver.

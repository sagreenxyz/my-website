# Summary: 24.7 Nutrition and Diet

This section discusses the essential components of a healthy diet, including macronutrients, micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), and the importance of balanced nutrition for overall health.

## Essential Nutrients:

*   **Definition:** Nutrients the body cannot synthesize in sufficient quantities and must be obtained from the diet.
*   **Categories:** Macronutrients (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins), vitamins, minerals, water.

## Macronutrients (Provide Energy and Building Blocks):

*   **Carbohydrates:**
    *   **Sources:** Sugars (fruits, milk), starch (grains, vegetables), fiber (vegetables, fruits, grains).
    *   **Use:** Primary energy source (glucose for ATP production). Fiber aids digestion.
    *   **Recommendations:** 45-65% of total caloric intake, emphasizing complex carbohydrates and fiber.
*   **Lipids (Fats):**
    *   **Sources:** Triglycerides (saturated fats in meat/dairy; unsaturated fats in seeds, nuts, oils), cholesterol (egg yolk, meat, milk products). Essential fatty acids (linoleic, linolenic) found in vegetable oils.
    *   **Use:** Energy storage, absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, cell membrane components, myelin sheaths, hormone synthesis (steroids), cushioning organs.
    *   **Recommendations:** 20-35% of total caloric intake, limiting saturated and trans fats.
*   **Proteins:**
    *   **Sources:** Complete proteins (contain all essential amino acids) in eggs, milk, fish, most meats. Incomplete proteins in legumes, nuts, cereals.
    *   **Use:** Structural materials (keratin, collagen, elastin), functional molecules (enzymes, hormones, antibodies), energy source (if needed). Requires all essential amino acids for synthesis.
    *   **Recommendations:** 0.8 g per kg body weight; 10-35% of total caloric intake. Nitrogen balance indicates protein synthesis vs. breakdown.

## Micronutrients (Required in Smaller Amounts, Crucial for Function):

*   **Vitamins:**
    *   **Definition:** Organic compounds needed for growth and health; function as coenzymes.
    *   **Types:**
        *   *Water-Soluble:* B vitamins (coenzymes in metabolism), Vitamin C (antioxidant, collagen synthesis). Not stored significantly (except B12).
        *   *Fat-Soluble:* Vitamins A (vision, skin), D (calcium absorption), E (antioxidant), K (blood clotting). Stored in the body; excess can be toxic.
*   **Minerals:**
    *   **Definition:** Inorganic elements needed for various functions.
    *   **Examples & Functions:** Calcium (bones, muscle contraction), Phosphorus (bones, ATP), Potassium/Sodium (nerve function, fluid balance), Iron (hemoglobin), Iodine (thyroid hormones), Zinc (enzymes).

## Dietary Guidelines and Tools:

*   **MyPlate:** USDA guide illustrating relative proportions of food groups (fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, dairy) for a healthy meal.
*   **Food Labels:** Provide information on serving size, calories, nutrient content, and ingredients.
*   **Balanced Diet:** Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, healthy fats; limits processed foods, sugary drinks, saturated/trans fats, sodium.

Proper nutrition is fundamental for providing energy, supporting growth and repair, regulating body processes, and preventing deficiency diseases and chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.

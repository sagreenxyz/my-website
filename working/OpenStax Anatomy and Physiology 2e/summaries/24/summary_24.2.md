# Summary: 24.2 Carbohydrate Metabolism

This section focuses on the breakdown and synthesis of carbohydrates, particularly glucose, which is the body's primary fuel source for ATP production.

## Glucose Metabolism Overview:

*   **Goal:** Generate ATP (cellular energy currency).
*   **Central Molecule:** Glucose (C6H12O6).
*   **Overall Reaction (Cellular Respiration):** C6H12O6 + 6O2 â†’ 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP + Heat
*   **Three Major Pathways:**
    1.  Glycolysis
    2.  Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)
    3.  Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and Oxidative Phosphorylation

## 1. Glycolysis:

*   **Location:** Cytoplasm.
*   **Process:** Anaerobic (does not require oxygen). A 10-step pathway that breaks down one glucose molecule (6 carbons) into two pyruvic acid molecules (3 carbons each).
*   **Net Yield:** 2 ATP (substrate-level phosphorylation) and 2 NADH + H+ (reduced coenzyme carrying high-energy electrons).
*   **Fate of Pyruvic Acid:**
    *   **Aerobic Conditions (O2 present):** Pyruvic acid enters the mitochondria for further oxidation (Krebs cycle).
    *   **Anaerobic Conditions (O2 absent):** Pyruvic acid is converted to lactic acid to regenerate NAD+ needed for glycolysis to continue (fermentation). Lactic acid can later be converted back to pyruvic acid or glucose in the liver (Cori cycle).

## 2. Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):

*   **Location:** Mitochondrial matrix.
*   **Process:** Aerobic (requires oxygen indirectly, as ETC needs O2). Occurs after pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl-CoA (yielding 1 NADH + H+ and 1 CO2 per pyruvic acid).
    *   Acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) combines with oxaloacetic acid (4 carbons) to form citric acid (6 carbons).
    *   A cyclical series of reactions breaks down citric acid, regenerating oxaloacetic acid.
    *   Each turn (per acetyl-CoA) produces: 1 ATP (substrate-level phosphorylation), 3 NADH + H+, 1 FADH2 (another reduced coenzyme), and 2 CO2 (waste product).
*   **Total Yield per Glucose:** Since glucose yields two pyruvic acids (-> two acetyl-CoA), the cycle turns twice per glucose molecule.

## 3. Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and Oxidative Phosphorylation:

*   **Location:** Inner mitochondrial membrane.
*   **Process:** Aerobic (directly requires oxygen).
    *   **ETC:** High-energy electrons carried by NADH + H+ and FADH2 (from glycolysis and Krebs cycle) are passed along a series of protein carriers (cytochromes). Energy released during electron transfer is used to pump H+ ions from the matrix to the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient.
    *   **Oxidative Phosphorylation:** H+ ions flow back into the matrix down their electrochemical gradient through an enzyme complex called **ATP synthase**. This flow drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi. Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor, combining with electrons and H+ to form water (H2O).
*   **ATP Yield:** Generates the vast majority of ATP (~28-34 ATP per glucose).

## Glycogenesis, Glycogenolysis, and Gluconeogenesis:

*   **Glycogenesis:** Synthesis of glycogen (storage form of glucose) from glucose when glucose supplies exceed demand for ATP. Occurs mainly in liver and skeletal muscle. Stimulated by insulin.
*   **Glycogenolysis:** Breakdown of glycogen to release glucose when blood glucose levels drop. Occurs mainly in the liver (to release glucose into blood) and muscle (for its own use). Stimulated by glucagon and epinephrine.
*   **Gluconeogenesis:** Synthesis of new glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (like amino acids, lactic acid, glycerol) when glucose levels are very low and glycogen stores are depleted. Occurs primarily in the liver.

Carbohydrate metabolism involves interconnected pathways that break down glucose to generate ATP (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, ETC) and pathways that store or synthesize glucose (glycogenesis, gluconeogenesis) to maintain energy homeostasis.

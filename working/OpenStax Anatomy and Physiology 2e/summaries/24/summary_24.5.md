# Summary: 24.5 Metabolic States of the Body

This section describes the two major metabolic states—absorptive and postabsorptive—and the hormonal regulation that governs the shift between storing and mobilizing nutrients.

## Metabolic States Overview:

*   The body shifts between states depending on nutrient availability from digestion.
*   **Goal:** Maintain stable blood glucose levels, as glucose is the preferred energy source for the brain.

## Absorptive (Fed) State:

*   **Timing:** During and shortly after eating (up to ~4 hours post-meal).
*   **Characteristics:** Nutrients (glucose, amino acids, fats) are being absorbed from the GI tract into the blood. Blood glucose levels rise.
*   **Metabolic Focus:** Anabolism (building larger molecules) and energy storage. Excess nutrients are stored.
*   **Major Processes:**
    *   **Glucose:** Major energy fuel. Excess glucose converted to glycogen (in liver and muscles) or fat (triglycerides in adipose tissue and liver).
    *   **Triglycerides:** Absorbed as chylomicrons. Lipoprotein lipase releases fatty acids and glycerol, which are stored as triglycerides in adipose tissue. Some lipids used for synthesis or energy by certain tissues.
    *   **Amino Acids:** Taken up by cells for protein synthesis. Excess amino acids deaminated in the liver and used for ATP synthesis or converted to fat or glycogen for storage.
*   **Hormonal Control:** Primarily directed by **Insulin**.
    *   **Source:** Beta (β) cells of pancreatic islets.
    *   **Stimulus:** High blood glucose, high amino acids/fatty acids, parasympathetic activity.
    *   **Effects:** Increases glucose uptake by most cells (via GLUT4 transporter insertion), enhances glucose use and storage (glycogenesis, lipogenesis), promotes protein synthesis, inhibits glucose production by the liver (gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis).

## Postabsorptive (Fasting) State:

*   **Timing:** When the GI tract is empty and energy stores are mobilized (late morning, late afternoon, overnight).
*   **Characteristics:** Nutrient absorption ends. Blood glucose levels start to drop.
*   **Metabolic Focus:** Catabolism (breaking down stored reserves) to maintain blood glucose levels and supply energy.
*   **Major Processes (Glucose Sparing):**
    *   **Goal:** Maintain blood glucose for the brain. Other tissues switch to using fats for energy.
    *   **Sources of Blood Glucose:**
        1.  **Glycogenolysis:** Breakdown of glycogen stores (primarily in liver, also muscle for its own use). Liver glycogen is the first reserve tapped.
        2.  **Gluconeogenesis:** Synthesis of new glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (amino acids from protein breakdown, glycerol from fat breakdown) primarily in the liver (also kidneys). Occurs as glycogen stores deplete.
    *   **Fat Mobilization:** Triglycerides broken down (lipolysis) into fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids used by most tissues for ATP production. Liver converts fatty acids to ketone bodies for use by other tissues (including brain during prolonged fasting).
*   **Hormonal Control:** Primarily directed by **Glucagon** and supported by other hormones.
    *   **Source:** Alpha (α) cells of pancreatic islets.
    *   **Stimulus:** Low blood glucose, sympathetic stimulation.
    *   **Effects (Oppose Insulin):** Stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, promotes lipolysis in adipose tissue. Raises blood glucose levels.
    *   **Other Hormones:** Sympathetic nervous system (epinephrine/norepinephrine), cortisol, growth hormone also promote fat mobilization and gluconeogenesis, especially during prolonged fasting or stress.

The body dynamically shifts between absorptive (storage) and postabsorptive (mobilization) states, orchestrated mainly by insulin and glucagon, to ensure continuous energy availability and stable blood glucose levels.

# Summary: 26.5 Disorders of Acid-Base Balance

This section describes the common imbalances of acid-base homeostasis: acidosis (pH < 7.35) and alkalosis (pH > 7.45), categorized by their primary cause (respiratory or metabolic) and the body's compensatory responses.

## Acid-Base Imbalances:

*   **Respiratory Acidosis:**
    *   **Cause:** CO2 retention due to hypoventilation (e.g., lung disease, impaired respiratory drive). PCO2 is high.
    *   **Compensation:** Kidneys retain HCO3- and excrete H+.
*   **Respiratory Alkalosis:**
    *   **Cause:** Excessive CO2 elimination due to hyperventilation (e.g., anxiety, high altitude). PCO2 is low.
    *   **Compensation:** Kidneys excrete HCO3- and retain H+.
*   **Metabolic Acidosis:**
    *   **Cause:** Accumulation of fixed acids (e.g., ketoacidosis in diabetes, lactic acidosis) or excessive loss of HCO3- (e.g., severe diarrhea). HCO3- is low.
    *   **Compensation:** Respiratory system increases ventilation to blow off CO2 (Kussmaul respirations); kidneys retain HCO3- and excrete H+.
*   **Metabolic Alkalosis:**
    *   **Cause:** Loss of acid (e.g., vomiting, excessive antacid intake) or gain of base. HCO3- is high.
    *   **Compensation:** Respiratory system decreases ventilation to retain CO2; kidneys excrete HCO3- and retain H+.

## Compensation:

*   The system not primarily affected attempts to correct the pH imbalance.
*   **Respiratory Compensation:** Alters ventilation to adjust PCO2 (occurs quickly).
*   **Renal Compensation:** Adjusts HCO3- and H+ excretion/retention (occurs more slowly).
*   **Complete Compensation:** pH returns to the normal range (though PCO2 or HCO3- may still be abnormal).
*   **Partial Compensation:** pH moves towards normal but remains outside the range.

Diagnosis involves measuring arterial blood gases (pH, PCO2, HCO3-) to identify the primary disturbance and assess compensation.

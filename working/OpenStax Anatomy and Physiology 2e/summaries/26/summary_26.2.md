# Summary: 26.2 Water Balance

This section details how the body maintains a stable water volume, balancing water intake with water output. This balance is essential for maintaining blood pressure, cell volume, and overall physiological function.

## Regulation of Water Balance:

*   **Water Intake:**
    *   **Beverages:** Largest source.
    *   **Foods:** Significant contribution.
    *   **Metabolic Water:** Water produced during cellular respiration.
    *   Regulated primarily by the **thirst mechanism** located in the hypothalamus, triggered by increased plasma osmolarity, dry mouth, decreased blood volume/pressure, and angiotensin II.
*   **Water Output:**
    *   **Urine:** Largest component, regulated by kidneys.
    *   **Insensible Water Loss:** Skin evaporation and water vapor in expired air.
    *   **Perspiration (Sweat):** Varies with activity and temperature.
    *   **Feces:** Small amount.
*   **Hormonal Control:**
    *   **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH):** Released from the posterior pituitary in response to high osmolarity or low blood pressure. Increases water reabsorption in the kidney collecting ducts, reducing urine output.
*   **Disorders:**
    *   **Dehydration:** Negative water balance (output > intake). Leads to concentrated ECF, thirst, dry mucous membranes, decreased urine output.
    *   **Hypotonic Hydration (Water Intoxication):** Excessive water intake dilutes ECF, leading to cell swelling (edema), particularly dangerous in the brain.

Maintaining water balance involves coordinating intake via thirst and output via hormonal control of kidney function.

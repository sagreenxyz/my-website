# Summary: 26.4 Acid-Base Balance

This section explains the mechanisms the body uses to maintain the pH of body fluids within a narrow, slightly alkaline range (typically 7.35-7.45). This is vital as pH affects protein structure and enzyme function.

## Mechanisms for Maintaining pH:

*   **Sources of Acids/Bases:**
    *   Metabolism produces acids (e.g., carbonic acid from CO2, lactic acid, ketone bodies).
    *   Diet can contribute acids or bases.
*   **Buffer Systems (First Line of Defense):** Act rapidly to resist pH changes.
    *   **Bicarbonate Buffer System:** Primary ECF buffer. H2CO3 (weak acid) and HCO3- (weak base) buffer strong acids/bases. Relies on availability of bicarbonate reserve and links to respiratory system (CO2).
    *   **Phosphate Buffer System:** Important buffer in ICF and urine. Uses H2PO4- (weak acid) and HPO42- (weak base).
    *   **Protein Buffer System:** Most plentiful buffer in ICF and plasma. Amphoteric molecules (e.g., hemoglobin, plasma proteins) can act as weak acids or bases.
*   **Respiratory Regulation (Second Line of Defense):** Acts within minutes.
    *   Changes in respiratory rate alter CO2 levels in blood.
    *   Increased CO2 (or H+) stimulates deeper, faster breathing to exhale more CO2, raising pH.
    *   Decreased CO2 (or H+) leads to slower, shallower breathing to retain CO2, lowering pH.
*   **Renal Regulation (Third Line, Most Potent):** Acts over hours to days.
    *   Kidneys excrete metabolic acids (fixed acids like phosphoric acid, uric acid).
    *   Kidneys conserve (reabsorb) or generate new HCO3- to replenish the bicarbonate buffer.
    *   Kidneys excrete HCO3- when pH is too high.
    *   Secretion of H+ (often buffered by phosphate or ammonia/ammonium in urine) is coupled with HCO3- reabsorption/generation.

Acid-base balance depends on the coordinated action of chemical buffers, the respiratory system, and the renal system.

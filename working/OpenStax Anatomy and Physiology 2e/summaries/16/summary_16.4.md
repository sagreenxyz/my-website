# Summary: 16.4 The Sensory and Motor Exams

This section covers the assessment of sensory pathways (transmitting information from the periphery to the CNS) and motor pathways (transmitting commands from the CNS to muscles).

## Sensory Exam:

*   **Purpose:** To evaluate the integrity of sensory pathways, including peripheral nerves, spinal cord tracts (spinothalamic and dorsal columns), brainstem, thalamus, and somatosensory cortex.
*   **Modalities Tested:**
    *   **Light Touch:** Using cotton wisp. Tests both dorsal column (fine touch discrimination) and spinothalamic pathways.
    *   **Pain (Sharp/Dull):** Using a broken cotton swab or pin. Primarily tests the spinothalamic tract.
    *   **Temperature:** Using tuning fork (cool) or tubes with warm/cold water. Tests spinothalamic tract.
    *   **Vibration:** Using a tuning fork placed on bony prominences (e.g., toe, finger joint, malleolus). Tests dorsal column pathway.
    *   **Proprioception (Joint Position Sense):** Moving a patient's digit up or down (eyes closed) and asking them to identify the direction. Tests dorsal column pathway.
*   **Procedure:** Compare sensations side-to-side, proximal vs. distal, and map out areas of sensory loss (dermatomes can help localize spinal nerve root lesions). Patient's eyes are typically closed.
*   **Higher Cortical Sensations (Integrative):** Tested if primary sensation is intact; assess parietal lobe function.
    *   **Stereognosis:** Identifying objects by touch alone.
    *   **Graphesthesia:** Identifying numbers/letters traced on skin.
    *   **Two-Point Discrimination:** Ability to distinguish one or two points touching the skin.
    *   **Extinction:** Failure to perceive a stimulus on one side when both sides are stimulated simultaneously.

## Motor Exam:

*   **Purpose:** To evaluate the integrity of motor pathways, including the corticospinal tract (upper motor neurons - UMN), brainstem, spinal cord (lower motor neurons - LMN), peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, and muscles.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Observation/Inspection:** Look for muscle wasting (atrophy), involuntary movements (fasciculations, tremors, chorea), posture.
    *   **Muscle Tone:** Assess resistance to passive movement of limbs (normal, increased - spasticity/rigidity, decreased - flaccidity). Spasticity suggests UMN lesion; flaccidity suggests LMN lesion.
    *   **Muscle Strength:** Test major muscle groups bilaterally against resistance, graded on a 0-5 scale (0=no contraction, 3=movement against gravity only, 5=normal strength). Compare side-to-side. Test proximal and distal muscles.
    *   **Reflexes (Deep Tendon Reflexes - DTRs):** Assess the integrity of the reflex arc (sensory nerve, spinal cord segment, LMN, muscle). Examples: biceps (C5/6), triceps (C7/8), patellar (L3/4), Achilles (S1/2). Graded 0-4+ (2+ is normal).
        *   **Hyperreflexia:** Exaggerated reflexes, often indicates UMN lesion (loss of inhibition from above).
        *   **Hyporeflexia/Areflexia:** Diminished/absent reflexes, often indicates LMN lesion or peripheral neuropathy.
    *   **Plantar Response (Babinski Sign):** Stroking the sole of the foot. Normal response is toe flexion. Abnormal (Babinski sign present) is extension of the big toe and fanning of other toes, indicating UMN lesion in adults.

The sensory and motor exams provide critical information for localizing lesions within the central and peripheral nervous systems.

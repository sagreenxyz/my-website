# Summary: 16.1 Overview of the Neurological Exam

This section introduces the neurological exam as a clinical assessment tool used to determine the location and extent of nervous system dysfunction.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Purpose:** To assess the function of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) through a series of standardized tests. It helps localize lesions (damage or abnormalities) within the nervous system.
*   **Localization of Function:** The principle that specific neurological functions are controlled by distinct regions of the brain, spinal cord, or specific peripheral nerves. Damage to a particular area results in predictable deficits.
*   **Major Sections of the Exam:** The neurological exam is typically divided into five major sections, often performed in sequence:
    1.  **Mental Status Exam:** Assesses higher cognitive functions (cerebrum).
    2.  **Cranial Nerve Exam:** Tests the function of the 12 cranial nerves (diencephalon, brain stem, specific peripheral nerves).
    3.  **Sensory Exam:** Evaluates the pathways transmitting sensory information from the periphery to the brain (spinal cord, brain stem, cerebrum).
    4.  **Motor Exam:** Assesses the pathways controlling movement from the brain to the muscles (cerebrum, brain stem, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, cerebellum).
    5.  **Coordination Exam (including Gait):** Specifically tests cerebellar function and integrated sensory/motor control involved in balance and walking.
*   **Clinical Application:** Used by neurologists and other healthcare providers to diagnose neurological disorders (stroke, multiple sclerosis, tumors, nerve injuries, etc.), monitor disease progression, and evaluate treatment effectiveness.
*   **Relationship to Symptoms:** The specific tests performed may be guided by the patient's reported symptoms (e.g., weakness, numbness, vision changes, dizziness).

The neurological exam is a powerful diagnostic tool based on understanding the anatomical organization and functional localization within the nervous system.

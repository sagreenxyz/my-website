# Summary: Chapter 16 Key Terms

This section lists important terminology related to the neurological exam discussed in Chapter 16.

*(Note: The specific terms are derived from the HTML content provided previously. Below is a representation of the types of terms typically found.)*

*   **Agnosia:** Loss of ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells while the specific sense is not defective nor is there any significant memory loss.
*   **Aphasia:** Loss of ability to understand or express speech, caused by brain damage. (Includes Broca's, Wernicke's).
*   **Apraxia:** Inability to perform particular purposive actions, as a result of brain damage.
*   **Ataxia:** Lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements.
*   **Babinski Sign:** Extension of the big toe and fanning of other toes in response to plantar stimulation; indicates UMN lesion in adults.
*   **Clonus:** Series of involuntary, rhythmic, muscular contractions and relaxations.
*   **Cranial Nerves:** Twelve pairs of nerves that emerge directly from the brain, primarily serving the head and neck.
*   **Dermatome:** Area of skin supplied by sensory neurons that arise from a single spinal nerve ganglion.
*   **Diadochokinesia:** Ability to make antagonistic movements in quick succession, alternately bringing a limb into opposite positions, as of flexion and extension or of pronation and supination. (Dysdiadochokinesia is impairment).
*   **Dysmetria:** Lack of coordination of movement typified by the undershoot or overshoot of intended position with the hand, arm, leg, or eye.
*   **Fasciculation:** A brief, spontaneous contraction affecting a small number of muscle fibers, often causing a flicker of movement under the skin.
*   **Gait:** A person's manner of walking.
*   **Gnosis:** Knowledge or recognition. (Stereognosis, Graphesthesia).
*   **Hyperreflexia:** Overactive or overresponsive reflexes.
*   **Hyporeflexia:** Below normal or absent reflexes.
*   **Lower Motor Neuron (LMN):** Motor neuron connecting the brainstem/spinal cord to muscle fibers. Lesions cause flaccidity, atrophy, fasciculations, hyporeflexia.
*   **Mental Status Exam:** Assessment of cognitive and behavioral functioning.
*   **Nystagmus:** Involuntary rapid eye movements.
*   **Proprioception:** Sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement.
*   **Ptosis:** Drooping or falling of the upper eyelid.
*   **Reflex:** An involuntary and nearly instantaneous movement in response to a stimulus.
*   **Rigidity:** Stiffness or inflexibility of muscles.
*   **Romberg Test:** Test of balance requiring healthy proprioception and vestibular function.
*   **Sensorium:** Aspects of consciousness and alertness.
*   **Spasticity:** Condition in which muscles stiffen or tighten, preventing normal fluid movement; often associated with UMN lesions.
*   **Upper Motor Neuron (UMN):** Motor neuron originating in the motor cortex or brainstem that controls LMNs. Lesions cause spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign.

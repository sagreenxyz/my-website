# Summary: 16.5 The Coordination and Gait Exams

This section focuses on assessing coordinated movements and balance, primarily evaluating the function of the cerebellum and its connections with motor and sensory systems.

## Coordination Exam:

*   **Purpose:** To test the cerebellum's role in producing smooth, accurate, and timed movements. Cerebellar dysfunction leads to ataxia (lack of coordination).
*   **Key Tests:**
    *   **Finger-to-Nose Test:** Patient alternately touches their nose and the examiner's finger (which may move). Tests for dysmetria (inability to judge distance or scale) and intention tremor (tremor worsening as target is approached).
    *   **Heel-to-Shin Test:** Patient slides the heel of one foot down the shin of the opposite leg while supine. Tests for lower limb coordination and ataxia.
    *   **Rapid Alternating Movements (RAMs):**
        *   **Diadochokinesia:** Ability to perform rapid alternating movements. Tested by asking the patient to rapidly pronate/supinate their hands on their thighs or tap their fingers quickly.
        *   **Dysdiadochokinesia:** Inability to perform RAMs smoothly; movements are slow, irregular, or clumsy. Characteristic of cerebellar lesions.
    *   **Check Reflex (Rebound Phenomenon):** Examiner pulls on patient's flexed arm and suddenly releases. Normally, antagonist muscles contract to check excessive movement. Failure to check (excessive rebound) suggests cerebellar issue.

## Gait Exam:

*   **Purpose:** To assess integrated function of motor pathways, sensory pathways (especially proprioception and vestibular), basal ganglia, and cerebellum involved in walking and balance.
*   **Procedure:** Observe the patient during normal walking:
    *   **Stance:** Width of base (wide base suggests instability).
    *   **Posture:** Upright or stooped.
    *   **Step Length & Symmetry:** Equal, adequate length.
    *   **Arm Swing:** Present and symmetrical.
    *   **Steadiness:** Smoothness, balance, tendency to fall.
    *   **Turning:** Smoothness and stability during turns.
*   **Specific Gait Tests:**
    *   **Tandem Gait:** Walking heel-to-toe in a straight line. Exaggerates instability and is sensitive for truncal ataxia (midline cerebellar dysfunction).
    *   **Walking on Heels/Toes:** Tests distal strength (dorsiflexion/plantarflexion) and balance.
    *   **Hopping on One Foot:** Tests strength and balance.
    *   **Romberg Test:** Patient stands with feet together, first with eyes open, then closed. Increased sway or falling with eyes closed (positive Romberg) indicates sensory ataxia (impaired proprioception or vestibular function), as visual input can no longer compensate. Cerebellar ataxia causes instability with eyes open or closed.
    *   **Pronator Drift:** Patient holds arms outstretched, palms up, eyes closed. Downward drift and pronation of one arm suggests contralateral corticospinal tract lesion.

Coordination and gait exams are crucial for detecting cerebellar dysfunction and problems with integrating sensory and motor information for balance and movement.

# Summary: 16.3 The Cranial Nerve Exam

This section describes the tests used to assess the function of the twelve cranial nerves (CNs), which provide sensory and motor innervation primarily to the head and neck. Deficits can help localize lesions in the brainstem or along the course of the nerves.

## Cranial Nerves and Tests:

*   **CN I (Olfactory):** Sense of smell. Tested by having the patient identify common scents (coffee, vanilla) presented to each nostril separately (eyes closed).
*   **CN II (Optic):** Vision. Tested by:
    *   **Visual Acuity:** Using a Snellen eye chart.
    *   **Visual Fields:** Testing peripheral vision by confrontation (comparing patient's field to examiner's).
    *   **Fundoscopy:** Examining the retina and optic disc with an ophthalmoscope.
    *   **Pupillary Light Reflex (Afferent limb):** Light shone in one eye should cause both pupils to constrict; tests optic nerve input.
*   **CN III (Oculomotor):** Controls most eye movements (superior/inferior/medial rectus, inferior oblique), eyelid elevation (levator palpebrae), and pupillary constriction/accommodation (parasympathetic). Tested by:
    *   **Eye Movements:** Tracking examiner's finger in an "H" pattern (assessed with CN IV and VI). Look for ptosis (drooping eyelid).
    *   **Pupillary Light Reflex (Efferent limb):** Checks pupillary constriction in response to light.
    *   **Accommodation:** Pupil constriction when focusing on a near object.
*   **CN IV (Trochlear):** Controls superior oblique muscle (moves eye down and inward). Tested during eye movement assessment (tracking finger). Difficulty looking down and in suggests palsy.
*   **CN V (Trigeminal):** Major sensory nerve for the face and controls muscles of mastication.
    *   **Sensory:** Testing light touch, pain, and temperature sensation in three divisions (ophthalmic V1, maxillary V2, mandibular V3). Corneal reflex (blinking when cornea touched) involves V1 afferent, CN VII efferent.
    *   **Motor:** Palpating masseter and temporalis muscles while patient clenches jaw; checking jaw opening against resistance.
*   **CN VI (Abducens):** Controls lateral rectus muscle (moves eye outward/abducts). Tested during eye movement assessment. Inability to abduct the eye suggests palsy.
*   **CN VII (Facial):** Controls muscles of facial expression, taste (anterior 2/3 tongue), salivation (submandibular/sublingual glands), lacrimation. Tested by:
    *   **Motor:** Asking patient to smile, frown, raise eyebrows, puff cheeks, close eyes tightly against resistance. Note asymmetry.
    *   **Taste:** Can be tested with sweet/salty solutions (less common).
*   **CN VIII (Vestibulocochlear):** Hearing and balance.
    *   **Hearing:** Rubbing fingers or whispering near each ear. Rinne and Weber tests using a tuning fork help differentiate conductive vs. sensorineural hearing loss.
    *   **Balance (Vestibular):** Often assessed during coordination/gait exam (less specific in standard CN exam).
*   **CN IX (Glossopharyngeal):** Taste (posterior 1/3 tongue), sensation from pharynx/palate, salivation (parotid gland), swallowing (stylopharyngeus muscle). Tested with CN X.
*   **CN X (Vagus):** Parasympathetic control of viscera, motor control of pharynx/larynx (swallowing, voice), sensation from pharynx/larynx, taste from epiglottis. Tested with CN IX by:
    *   **Gag Reflex:** Touching posterior pharynx (afferent CN IX, efferent CN X).
    *   **Palate Elevation:** Observing uvula movement when patient says "Ahh" (should rise symmetrically).
    *   **Voice Quality:** Listening for hoarseness.
    *   **Swallowing:** Observing swallowing.
*   **CN XI (Accessory):** Controls sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. Tested by:
    *   **Trapezius:** Shrugging shoulders against resistance.
    *   **Sternocleidomastoid:** Turning head against resistance.
*   **CN XII (Hypoglossal):** Controls tongue movements. Tested by:
    *   Asking patient to protrude tongue (should be midline; deviates *towards* side of lesion).
    *   Checking tongue strength against cheek.

The cranial nerve exam systematically evaluates brainstem function and specific sensory/motor pathways of the head and neck.

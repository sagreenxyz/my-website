# Summary: Chapter 16 Chapter Review - The Neurological Exam

This chapter review consolidates the information presented about the neurological exam, a clinical assessment tool for nervous system function.

## Key Concepts Recapped:

*   **16.1 Overview:** The neurological exam systematically assesses nervous system function based on the principle of localization. It comprises five main sections: mental status, cranial nerves, sensory, motor, and coordination/gait.
*   **16.2 Mental Status:** Evaluates higher cognitive functions (cerebrum) including orientation (person, place, time, situation), memory (registration, short-term, long-term), language (fluency, comprehension, naming, repetition), sensorium (attention, praxis, gnosis), and judgment/abstract reasoning.
*   **16.3 Cranial Nerves:** Tests the function of the 12 cranial nerves (CN I-XII) assessing smell, vision, eye movements, pupillary response, facial sensation and movement, hearing, balance, taste, swallowing, phonation, and head/neck/tongue movements. Helps localize brainstem lesions.
*   **16.4 Sensory and Motor Exams:**
    *   **Sensory:** Assesses pathways for light touch, pain, temperature, vibration, and proprioception, comparing side-to-side and mapping deficits. Includes tests for cortical sensation (stereognosis, graphesthesia).
    *   **Motor:** Evaluates muscle bulk, tone, strength (0-5 scale), and reflexes (DTRs, plantar response). Differentiates between upper motor neuron (UMN - spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski) and lower motor neuron (LMN - flaccidity, atrophy, hyporeflexia) signs.
*   **16.5 Coordination and Gait:** Assesses cerebellar function and integration of sensory/motor systems. Coordination tests include finger-to-nose, heel-to-shin, and rapid alternating movements (testing for dysmetria, intention tremor, dysdiadochokinesia). Gait exam observes walking, turning, tandem gait, and includes the Romberg test (sensory vs. cerebellar ataxia).

The neurological exam is a fundamental clinical skill integrating knowledge of neuroanatomy and physiology to diagnose and localize nervous system disorders.

## Check Your Understanding

1.  What are the five main sections of a neurological exam (16.1)?
2.  List three aspects evaluated in the mental status exam (16.2).
3.  Why is testing cranial nerves important in a neurological exam (16.3)?
4.  What is the difference between an Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) sign and a Lower Motor Neuron (LMN) sign in the motor exam (16.4)? Give an example of each.
5.  Name one test used to assess coordination and state what part of the brain it primarily evaluates (16.5).

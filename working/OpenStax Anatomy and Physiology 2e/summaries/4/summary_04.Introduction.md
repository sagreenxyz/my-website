# Summary: Chapter 4 Introduction - The Tissue Level of Organization

This introductory section bridges the gap between individual cells and complex organs by focusing on tissues â€“ groups of similar cells working together to perform specific functions. It introduces the concept that the vast complexity of the human body arises from combinations of just four primary tissue types: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous tissue. The chapter will delve into the distinct characteristics, classifications, locations, and functions of each of these primary tissues, laying the groundwork for understanding how organs are constructed.

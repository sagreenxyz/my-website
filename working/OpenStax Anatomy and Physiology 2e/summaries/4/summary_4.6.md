# Summary: 4.6 Tissue Injury and Aging

This section discusses the body's response to tissue injury, including inflammation and repair processes, as well as the effects of aging on tissues.

## Tissue Injury Response:

*   Injury triggers an inflammatory response and initiates repair.
*   **Inflammation:**
    *   **Purpose:** Localized response to isolate the injured area, destroy pathogens/debris, and set the stage for repair.
    *   **Signs:** Redness, heat, swelling, pain (sometimes loss of function).
    *   **Process:** Release of inflammatory chemicals (histamine, etc.) causes vasodilation (→ redness, heat) and increased capillary permeability (→ fluid leakage, edema/swelling, pain). Clotting factors form a clot to stop bleeding and isolate area. Phagocytes (neutrophils, macrophages) migrate to clean up debris and pathogens.
*   **Tissue Repair:** Occurs via two main processes:
    *   **Regeneration:** Replacement of destroyed tissue with the *same kind* of tissue. Original function is restored. Occurs in tissues with high regenerative capacity (e.g., epithelium, bone, areolar CT, dense irregular CT, blood-forming tissue).
    *   **Fibrosis:** Replacement of destroyed tissue with fibrous connective tissue (scar tissue). Original function is lost. Occurs when damage is severe or in tissues with low regenerative capacity.
*   **Steps in Repair:**
    1.  **Inflammation sets stage** (as above).
    2.  **Organization restores blood supply:** Clot is replaced by granulation tissue (new capillaries, fibroblasts). Fibroblasts produce collagen fibers. Macrophages continue cleanup. Epithelial cells migrate over granulation tissue.
    3.  **Regeneration and fibrosis effect permanent repair:** Surface epithelium regenerates under scab. Fibrous tissue matures and contracts; scar tissue forms (fibrosis). Result is a regenerated epithelium with underlying scar tissue.

## Regenerative Capacity of Tissues:

*   **Very High:** Epithelial tissues, bone, areolar CT, dense irregular CT, blood-forming tissue.
*   **Moderate:** Smooth muscle, dense regular CT.
*   **Weak:** Skeletal muscle, cartilage.
*   **Virtually None:** Cardiac muscle, nervous tissue in brain and spinal cord. (Destroyed cells replaced by scar tissue).

## Effects of Aging:

*   Tissues generally become thinner, more fragile, and repair more slowly with age.
*   Epithelia thin, glands become less active.
*   Connective tissues lose pliability and resiliency (collagen changes, less elastin). Bone becomes porous and weakens (osteoporosis). Cartilage wears down.
*   Muscle mass decreases (atrophy), strength declines.
*   Nervous tissue atrophy can occur.
*   Circulation may decrease, impairing nutrient/oxygen delivery for repair.
*   Increased risk of cancer due to accumulated DNA damage/mutations.

The body's ability to repair damaged tissue is crucial for maintaining health and function.

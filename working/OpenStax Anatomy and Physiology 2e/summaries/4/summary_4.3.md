# Summary: 4.3 Connective Tissue Supports and Protects

This section explores connective tissue, the most abundant and diverse primary tissue type, characterized by cells scattered within an extensive extracellular matrix (ECM).

## General Characteristics & Functions:

*   **Functions:** Binding and support, protection, insulation, storing reserve fuel (fat), transporting substances (blood).
*   **Common Origin:** All arise from mesenchyme (an embryonic tissue).
*   **Varying Vascularity:** Ranges from avascular (cartilage) to highly vascularized (bone).
*   **Extracellular Matrix (ECM):** Largely non-living matrix separates cells. Allows tissue to bear weight, withstand tension, endure abuse. Composed of:
    *   **Ground Substance:** Unstructured material filling space between cells and fibers. Contains interstitial fluid, cell adhesion proteins, proteoglycans (trap water, affect viscosity).
    *   **Fibers:** Provide support.
        *   **Collagen Fibers:** Strongest, most abundant; provide high tensile strength (resist pulling). White fibers.
        *   **Elastic Fibers:** Long, thin fibers containing elastin; allow stretch and recoil. Yellow fibers. Found in skin, lungs, blood vessel walls.
        *   **Reticular Fibers:** Short, fine, highly branched collagenous fibers. Form delicate networks (stroma) supporting soft tissues (e.g., spleen, lymph nodes).

## Cells:

*   **"Blast" Cells:** Immature, mitotically active cells that secrete ground substance and fibers specific to their tissue type.
    *   **Fibroblasts:** In connective tissue proper.
    *   **Chondroblasts:** In cartilage.
    *   **Osteoblasts:** In bone.
    *   **Hematopoietic Stem Cells:** In bone marrow (produce blood cells; not fixed in tissue).
*   **"Cyte" Cells:** Mature, less active form of "blast" cells; maintain the matrix. (Fibrocytes, Chondrocytes, Osteocytes).
*   **Other Cells:** Adipocytes (fat cells), White Blood Cells (WBCs - neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes), Mast Cells (initiate local inflammatory response), Macrophages (phagocytic cells).

## Types of Connective Tissue:

1.  **Connective Tissue Proper:** All types except bone, cartilage, blood.
    *   **Loose Connective Tissue:** Fibers loosely arranged, more ground substance.
        *   **Areolar:** Gel-like matrix with all three fiber types; cells: fibroblasts, macrophages, mast cells, some WBCs. Wraps and cushions organs; macrophages phagocytize bacteria; plays role in inflammation; holds tissue fluid. Widely distributed under epithelia.
        *   **Adipose:** Matrix like areolar but sparse; closely packed adipocytes (fat cells) dominate. Provides reserve fuel; insulates; supports/protects organs. Located under skin (subcutaneous), around kidneys/eyeballs, abdomen, breasts.
        *   **Reticular:** Network of reticular fibers in loose ground substance; reticular cells lie on network. Forms soft internal skeleton (stroma) supporting other cell types (WBCs, mast cells, macrophages). Located in lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen).
    *   **Dense Connective Tissue (Fibrous):** Fibers densely packed, less ground substance.
        *   **Dense Regular:** Primarily parallel collagen fibers; few elastic fibers; major cell type is fibroblast. Attaches muscles to bones (tendons), bones to bones (ligaments); withstands great tensile stress in one direction.
        *   **Dense Irregular:** Primarily irregularly arranged collagen fibers; some elastic fibers; fibroblasts. Withstands tension exerted in many directions; provides structural strength. Located in fibrous capsules of organs/joints, dermis of skin, submucosa of digestive tract.
        *   **Elastic:** Dense regular tissue containing high proportion of elastic fibers. Allows recoil after stretching. Located in walls of large arteries, certain ligaments (vertebral column), walls of bronchial tubes.
2.  **Cartilage:** Tough yet flexible; avascular; lacks nerve fibers. Chondroblasts produce matrix; mature chondrocytes lie in lacunae. Withstands tension and compression.
    *   **Hyaline Cartilage:** Most abundant. Amorphous but firm matrix; collagen fibers form imperceptible network. Supports and reinforces; resilient cushion; resists compressive stress. Forms embryonic skeleton, covers ends of long bones (articular cartilage), costal cartilages (ribs), nose, trachea, larynx.
    *   **Elastic Cartilage:** Similar to hyaline but more elastic fibers. Maintains shape while allowing great flexibility. Supports external ear (pinna), epiglottis.
    *   **Fibrocartilage:** Matrix similar but less firm than hyaline; thick collagen fibers predominate. High tensile strength, absorbs compressive shock. Located in intervertebral discs, pubic symphysis, discs of knee joint (menisci).
3.  **Bone (Osseous Tissue):** Hard, calcified matrix containing many collagen fibers; osteocytes lie in lacunae. Very well vascularized. Supports and protects; provides levers for muscles; stores calcium/minerals/fat; marrow inside bones is site for blood cell formation (hematopoiesis).
4.  **Blood:** Atypical connective tissue; fluid matrix (plasma) containing RBCs, WBCs, platelets. Fibers are soluble proteins visible during clotting. Transports respiratory gases, nutrients, wastes, hormones. Contained within blood vessels.

Connective tissues provide the structural framework and support system for the entire body.

## Check Your Understanding

1.  What are the three common structural elements found in all connective tissues?
2.  What are the two main components of the extracellular matrix in connective tissue? What is the general function of ground substance versus fibers?
3.  List the four main classes of connective tissue.
4.  For "Connective Tissue Proper," name its two subclasses. Then, for each subclass, name one specific type of tissue, its main cell type, and one primary function/location.
5.  Name the three types of cartilage. How do they differ in terms of fiber composition and general properties/locations?

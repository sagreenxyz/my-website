# Summary: 4.5 Nervous Tissue Mediates Perception and Response

This section describes nervous tissue, the main component of the nervous system, which regulates and controls body functions through the transmission of electrical signals.

## Function:

*   Forms the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.
*   Responsible for receiving stimuli (sensory input), processing information (integration), and transmitting signals to elicit responses (motor output) in muscles and glands.

## Cell Types:

Nervous tissue is composed of two major cell types:

1.  **Neurons:**
    *   The primary functional units of the nervous system.
    *   Specialized to generate and conduct electrical impulses (action potentials).
    *   **Structure:** Typically consist of:
        *   **Cell Body (Soma/Perikaryon):** Contains the nucleus and most organelles; biosynthetic center.
        *   **Dendrites:** Short, branching extensions that receive signals from other neurons and transmit them *towards* the cell body (input region).
        *   **Axon:** Single, long extension that generates and transmits nerve impulses (action potentials) *away* from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands (output region). May be myelinated.
    *   Amitotic (do not divide) in most cases; high metabolic rate.
2.  **Neuroglia (Glial Cells):**
    *   Supporting cells that surround, protect, insulate, and assist neurons.
    *   Outnumber neurons significantly.
    *   Different types exist in the Central Nervous System (CNS - brain and spinal cord) and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS - nerves outside CNS).
    *   **CNS Glia:** Astrocytes, Microglia, Ependymal cells, Oligodendrocytes (form myelin sheaths).
    *   **PNS Glia:** Satellite cells, Schwann cells (form myelin sheaths).
    *   Capable of mitosis (unlike most neurons).

Nervous tissue forms the body's primary communication network, enabling rapid control and coordination of body activities.

# Summary: 4.2 Epithelial Tissue

This section details the characteristics, classification, and functions of epithelial tissue, which forms coverings, linings, and glands.

## General Characteristics:

*   **Cellularity:** Composed almost entirely of tightly packed cells with minimal extracellular matrix.
*   **Specialized Contacts:** Cells joined by tight junctions and desmosomes, forming continuous sheets.
*   **Polarity:** Exhibits apical (free, exposed) and basal (attached) surfaces. Apical surface may have microvilli or cilia. Basal surface rests on a basement membrane.
*   **Avascularity:** Contains no blood vessels; nourished by diffusion from underlying connective tissue.
*   **Innervation:** Supplied by nerve fibers.
*   **Regeneration:** High capacity to regenerate via cell division.
*   **Supported by Connective Tissue:** Rests on and is supported by an underlying layer of connective tissue (e.g., lamina propria). Basement membrane lies between epithelium and connective tissue.

## Classification:

Based on two criteria: number of cell layers and shape of cells at the apical surface.

*   **Number of Layers:**
    *   **Simple Epithelium:** Single layer of cells. Functions in absorption, secretion, filtration.
    *   **Stratified Epithelium:** Two or more layers of cells. Functions in protection. Basal cells divide, push older cells apically.
*   **Cell Shape:**
    *   **Squamous:** Flattened, scale-like.
    *   **Cuboidal:** Box-like, cube-shaped.
    *   **Columnar:** Tall, column-shaped.

## Types of Epithelia:

*   **Simple Squamous:** Single layer, flattened cells. Allows rapid diffusion/filtration. Location: Air sacs of lungs, kidney glomeruli, lining of heart, blood vessels (endothelium), lymphatic vessels, lining of ventral body cavity (mesothelium).
*   **Simple Cuboidal:** Single layer, cube-like cells. Secretion and absorption. Location: Kidney tubules, ducts and secretory portions of small glands, ovary surface.
*   **Simple Columnar:** Single layer, tall cells; may have microvilli or cilia; may contain goblet cells (mucus secretion). Absorption and secretion. Location: Non-ciliated type lines digestive tract, gallbladder; ciliated type lines small bronchi, uterine tubes.
*   **Pseudostratified Columnar:** Single layer of cells of differing heights, nuclei at different levels; appears stratified but is simple; may have cilia and goblet cells. Secretion (mucus), propulsion of mucus by cilia. Location: Non-ciliated type in male sperm ducts; ciliated type lines trachea, most of upper respiratory tract.
*   **Stratified Squamous:** Multiple layers; basal cells cuboidal/columnar, surface cells squamous. Protects underlying tissues from abrasion. Location: Non-keratinized type forms moist linings (esophagus, mouth, vagina); keratinized type forms epidermis of skin (dry membrane).
*   **Stratified Cuboidal:** Rare. Typically two layers of cuboidal cells. Protection. Location: Ducts of larger glands (sweat, mammary).
*   **Stratified Columnar:** Rare. Basal cells usually cuboidal, superficial cells columnar. Protection, secretion. Location: Small amounts in male urethra, pharynx, some glandular ducts.
*   **Transitional Epithelium:** Resembles both stratified squamous and stratified cuboidal; basal cells cuboidal/columnar, surface cells dome-shaped or squamous-like depending on stretch. Stretches readily, permits distension. Location: Lines ureters, bladder, part of urethra.

## Glandular Epithelium:

*   **Gland:** One or more cells that make and secrete a particular product (secretion).
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Site of Product Release:**
        *   **Endocrine Glands:** Ductless; secrete hormones directly into bloodstream or lymph.
        *   **Exocrine Glands:** Secrete products onto body surfaces (skin) or into body cavities via ducts (e.g., sweat, oil, salivary, mucous glands).
    *   **Number of Cells:**
        *   **Unicellular:** Single cells (e.g., goblet cells).
        *   **Multicellular:** Composed of many cells; form ducts and secretory units. Classified by duct structure (simple/compound) and secretory unit shape (tubular/alveolar/tubuloalveolar).
    *   **Mode of Secretion (Multicellular Exocrine):**
        *   **Merocrine:** Secrete products by exocytosis (most common; e.g., sweat, pancreas, salivary).
        *   **Holocrine:** Accumulate products until cell ruptures (e.g., sebaceous glands).
        *   **Apocrine:** Accumulate products at apical portion, which pinches off (controversial in humans; possibly mammary glands).

Epithelial tissues are diverse and play critical roles in protection, secretion, absorption, excretion, filtration, diffusion, and sensory reception.

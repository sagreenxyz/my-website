# Summary: 4.4 Muscle Tissue and Motion

This section describes the three types of muscle tissue, which are specialized for contraction and responsible for producing movement in the body.

## General Characteristics:

*   Highly cellular and well-vascularized tissues.
*   Possess **myofilaments** (actin and myosin) that interact to generate force (contraction).
*   Responsible for all types of body movement.

## Types of Muscle Tissue:

1.  **Skeletal Muscle:**
    *   **Location:** Attached primarily to bones of the skeleton.
    *   **Function:** Produces voluntary movement of the skeleton (locomotion, manipulation); facial expression; maintains posture; stabilizes joints; generates heat.
    *   **Structure:** Long, cylindrical, multinucleate cells called **muscle fibers**. Exhibit obvious striations (bands) due to the regular arrangement of myofilaments.
    *   **Control:** Voluntary (under conscious control via the somatic nervous system).
2.  **Cardiac Muscle:**
    *   **Location:** Found only in the walls of the heart.
    *   **Function:** Propels blood into the circulation as it contracts.
    *   **Structure:** Branching cells that are generally uninucleate (sometimes binucleate). Exhibit striations. Cells are interconnected by **intercalated discs** (contain desmosomes and gap junctions), allowing coordinated contraction.
    *   **Control:** Involuntary (controlled by the autonomic nervous system and intrinsic pacemaker cells).
3.  **Smooth Muscle:**
    *   **Location:** Found mainly in the walls of hollow organs (e.g., digestive tract, urinary bladder, uterus, blood vessels).
    *   **Function:** Propels substances (food, urine, baby) along internal passageways; controls diameter of blood vessels and airways.
    *   **Structure:** Spindle-shaped (tapered) cells with a single central nucleus. No visible striations (myofilaments are present but not regularly arranged). Cells arranged in sheets.
    *   **Control:** Involuntary (controlled by the autonomic nervous system, hormones, local chemical factors).

Muscle tissues convert chemical energy (ATP) into mechanical energy, enabling movement at various levels, from locomotion to the transport of substances within organs.

Muscle tissue is essential for all types of body movement, both voluntary and involuntary.

2.  Name the three types of muscle tissue.
3.  Create a table comparing the three muscle tissue types based on the following characteristics:
    *   Location in the body
    *   Cell shape and appearance (e.g., striations, number of nuclei)
    *   Type of control (voluntary or involuntary)
4.  What are intercalated discs, and in which specific type of muscle tissue are they found? What is their functional importance?
5.  Which muscle tissue type has the greatest capacity for regeneration? Which has the least?

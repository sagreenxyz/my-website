# Summary: Chapter 4 Key Terms

This section lists important terminology related to the tissue level of organization discussed in Chapter 4.

*(Note: The specific terms are derived from the HTML content. Below is a representation of the types of terms typically found.)*

*   **Adipose Tissue:** Loose connective tissue dominated by adipocytes (fat cells).
*   **Apical Surface:** Free surface of epithelial cells.
*   **Areolar Tissue:** Loose connective tissue with a gel-like matrix, widely distributed.
*   **Basal Surface:** Surface of epithelial cells attached to the basement membrane.
*   **Basement Membrane:** Layer between epithelium and underlying connective tissue.
*   **Cartilage:** Supporting connective tissue with a firm matrix (hyaline, elastic, fibrocartilage).
*   **Collagen Fiber:** Strong, flexible fibrous protein in connective tissue.
*   **Connective Tissue:** Primary tissue type providing support, binding, and protection.
*   **Elastic Fiber:** Fibrous protein allowing stretch and recoil.
*   **Endocrine Gland:** Ductless gland secreting hormones into the bloodstream.
*   **Epithelial Tissue:** Primary tissue type covering surfaces, lining cavities, and forming glands.
*   **Exocrine Gland:** Gland secreting products onto a surface or into ducts.
*   **Extracellular Matrix:** Non-living material surrounding cells in connective tissue (ground substance + fibers).
*   **Fibroblast:** Primary cell type in connective tissue proper, producing matrix.
*   **Fibrosis:** Tissue repair involving scar tissue formation.
*   **Gland:** One or more cells that make and secrete a product.
*   **Ground Substance:** Unstructured material filling space between cells and fibers in connective tissue.
*   **Histology:** Study of tissues.
*   **Hormone:** Chemical messenger secreted by endocrine glands.
*   **Inflammation:** Body's response to tissue injury.
*   **Mucous Membrane (Mucosa):** Membrane lining cavities open to the exterior.
*   **Muscle Tissue:** Primary tissue type specialized for contraction (skeletal, cardiac, smooth).
*   **Nervous Tissue:** Primary tissue type forming the brain, spinal cord, and nerves (neurons, neuroglia).
*   **Neuron:** Nerve cell, transmitting electrical signals.
*   **Neuroglia (Glial Cells):** Supporting cells of nervous tissue.
*   **Regeneration:** Tissue repair involving replacement with the same kind of tissue.
*   **Reticular Fiber:** Fine collagenous fibers forming supportive networks.
*   **Serous Membrane (Serosa):** Membrane lining closed ventral body cavities and covering organs.
*   **Tissue:** Group of similar cells and their intercellular substance specialized for a particular function.

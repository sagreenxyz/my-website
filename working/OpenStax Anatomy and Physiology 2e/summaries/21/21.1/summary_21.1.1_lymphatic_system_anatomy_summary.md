# Summary: Anatomy and Function of the Lymphatic System

This document summarizes the key functions and structural components of the human lymphatic system.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Major Functions:**
    *   **Fluid Drainage:** Collects excess interstitial fluid (approx. 3L/day, derived from the 20L/day plasma filtered from capillaries) from tissue spaces and returns it to the bloodstream. Interstitial fluid is called **lymph** once it enters lymphatic vessels. System blockage can cause **lymphedema**.
    *   **Immune Cell Transport:** Provides routes for immune cells to travel from tissues back to circulation. **Lymph nodes** act as major staging areas for immune responses.
    *   **Dietary Lipid Transport:** Absorbs dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins from the gut via specialized lymphatic capillaries (**lacteals**) in the small intestine, forming a milky fluid called **chyle**.

*   **Structural Organization:**
    *   **Vessel Hierarchy:** Begins with blind-ended **lymphatic capillaries** (terminal lymphatics), which merge into larger **lymphatic vessels**, then **lymphatic trunks**, and finally **lymphatic ducts** that empty into the subclavian veins.
    *   **Lymphatic Capillaries:**
        *   Location: Interlaced with blood capillaries in most soft connective tissues (absent in CNS, bone marrow, bones, teeth, cornea).
        *   Structure: Single layer of overlapping endothelial cells forming one-way flaps. Anchored by collagen filaments.
        *   Function: Allow interstitial fluid entry when tissue pressure increases; flaps close at low pressure. Lacteals are specialized capillaries in the small intestine for chyle absorption.
    *   **Larger Lymphatic Vessels:** Similar structure to veins (three tunics) with numerous one-way valves, giving a beaded appearance.
    *   **Lymph Nodes:** ~500-600 small, bean-shaped organs along lymphatic vessels (common near groin, armpits, neck, chest, abdomen). Filter lymph and house immune cells.
    *   **Lymphatic Trunks:** Formed by the merging of superficial and deep lymphatic vessels (e.g., lumbar trunks, intestinal trunk).
    *   **Lymphatic Ducts:**
        *   **Right Lymphatic Duct:** Drains lymph from the upper right quadrant of the body (right head, thorax, arm) into the right subclavian vein.
        *   **Thoracic Duct:** Drains lymph from the rest of the body into the left subclavian vein. Begins as the **cisterna chyli** (sac below diaphragm collecting lymph from lower body/intestines).
    *   **Drainage Pattern:** Asymmetrical. Superficial lymphatics often follow veins; deep lymphatics often follow arteries.

*   **Lymph Flow:**
    *   Mechanism: Not pumped by the heart. Driven by body movements, skeletal muscle contractions, and breathing.
    *   Direction: One-way flow towards the heart ensured by valves in lymphatic vessels. Path: Capillaries -> Vessels -> Trunks -> Ducts -> Subclavian Veins.

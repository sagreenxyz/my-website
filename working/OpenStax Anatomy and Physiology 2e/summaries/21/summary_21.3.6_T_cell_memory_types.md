# Summary: 21.3.6 Immunological Memory and T Cell Types

This section discusses the cellular basis of immunological memory involving T cells and details the functions of different mature T cell types.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Immunological Memory:**
    *   A key feature of adaptive immunity.
    *   During a **primary adaptive response** (first exposure), both **effector T cells** (active fighters) and **memory T cells** are generated.
    *   **Memory T cells** are long-lived (can persist for life) and are "primed" to act quickly upon re-exposure.
    *   **Secondary adaptive response** (subsequent exposure): Memory T cells elicit a very rapid and strong response, generating large numbers of effector T cells quickly.
    *   This often overwhelms the pathogen before it causes symptoms, resulting in **immunity** to the disease. (Similar memory occurs in B cells).

*   **CD4 and CD8 Markers:**
    *   Mature T cells express either CD4 or CD8, but not both.
    *   These markers are cell adhesion molecules that help stabilize the interaction between the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell (APC) or target cell by binding directly to the MHC molecule (at a site different from the antigen-binding site).
        *   **CD4** binds to **MHC Class II**.
        *   **CD8** binds to **MHC Class I**.
    *   This dual binding (TCR-antigen/MHC and CD4/CD8-MHC) strengthens the connection.
    *   Generally, CD4+ T cells have helper functions, and CD8+ T cells have cytotoxic functions.

## Functional Types of T Cells:

*   **Helper T cells (T<sub>H</sub>, CD4+):**
    *   Function primarily by secreting **cytokines** to enhance and regulate other immune responses.
    *   Recognize antigen presented on **MHC Class II** (typically from extracellular pathogens).
    *   **Subsets:**
        *   **T<sub>H</sub>1 cells:** Secrete cytokines (e.g., Interferon-γ, TGF-β) that regulate macrophages and other T cells, promoting cell-mediated immunity (effective against intracellular pathogens).
        *   **T<sub>H</sub>2 cells:** Secrete cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) that act on B cells, driving their differentiation into antibody-producing plasma cells (effective against extracellular pathogens). Antibody responses to most protein antigens require T<sub>H</sub> cell help (**T cell-dependent antigens**).

*   **Cytotoxic T cells (T<sub>C</sub>, CD8+):**
    *   Recognize antigen presented on **MHC Class I** (typically from intracellular pathogens like viruses, or abnormal cells like tumor cells).
    *   Kill target cells directly by inducing **apoptosis**.
    *   Mechanisms:
        *   Express **Fas ligand** which binds to the Fas receptor on the target cell.
        *   Release **perforins** (create pores in target cell membrane) and **granzymes** (enzymes that trigger apoptosis) from cytoplasmic granules (similar to NK cells).
    *   Highly effective: can kill multiple target cells. Crucial for controlling viral infections and eliminating cancerous cells.

*   **Regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>, Suppressor T cells):**
    *   Typically express **CD4**, **CD25**, and the transcription factor **FOXP3**.
    *   Function to **suppress** other T cell immune responses.
    *   Essential for preventing excessive immune reactions, maintaining self-tolerance, and preventing autoimmune diseases. (Mechanisms still under investigation).

## Summary Table of T Cell Functions:

| T cell Type | Main Target(s) | Primary Function        | Typical Pathogen Type | Surface Marker(s) | MHC Restriction | Key Cytokines/Mediators                 |
| :---------- | :------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **T<sub>C</sub>**   | Infected cells | Cytotoxicity (Apoptosis) | Intracellular         | CD8               | Class I         | Perforins, Granzymes, Fas Ligand        |
| **T<sub>H</sub>1**  | Macrophages, T<sub>C</sub> cells | Activation, Regulation  | Intracellular (via CMI) | CD4               | Class II        | Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), TGF-β           |
| **T<sub>H</sub>2**  | B cells        | Activation, Antibody Production | Extracellular         | CD4               | Class II        | IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13        |
| **T<sub>reg</sub>** | Other T cells  | Suppression, Tolerance  | (Self/Regulation)     | CD4, CD25, FOXP3  | Class II (?)    | TGF-β, IL-10                            |

*(Note: Pathogen types listed are typical associations; T<sub>H</sub> cells coordinate responses to both types. MHC restriction for T<sub>reg</sub> activation/function is complex).*

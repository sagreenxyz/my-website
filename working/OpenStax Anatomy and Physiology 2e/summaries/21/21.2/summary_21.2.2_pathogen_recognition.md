# Summary: 21.2.2 Recognition of Pathogens (Innate Immunity)

This section explains how cells of the innate immune system recognize pathogens using pattern recognition receptors.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Recognition Mechanism:** Innate immune cells (phagocytes, NK cells) identify pathogens by detecting conserved molecular structures unique to microbes.
*   **Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs):**
    *   Membrane-bound receptors expressed on innate immune cells.
    *   Recognize **Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)** - characteristic features of pathogens (e.g., bacterial cell wall components, flagellar proteins) - and molecules released by stressed/damaged host cells (DAMPs).
    *   Always present on the cell surface (constitutively expressed).
*   **Evolution and Limitations:**
    *   PRRs are thought to have evolved before adaptive immunity.
    *   Their variety is limited because:
        1.  Each PRR type requires a specific gene.
        2.  Finite cell surface area restricts the number of receptors.
    *   The innate system uses a limited set of PRRs effective against a broad range of pathogens.
*   **Contrast with Adaptive Immunity:** The adaptive immune system uses a vast number of highly specific receptors (TCRs, BCRs), each tailored to a particular pathogen/antigen.
*   **Outcome of Recognition:** When a PRR on an innate immune cell binds to a recognized pathogen pattern:
    *   Phagocytes initiate **phagocytosis** to engulf and destroy the microbe.
    *   NK cells can induce **apoptosis** in infected host cells.
*   **Receptor Types:** Include receptors for various bacterial components and for complement proteins.

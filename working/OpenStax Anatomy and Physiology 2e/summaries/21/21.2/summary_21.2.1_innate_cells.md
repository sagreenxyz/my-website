# Summary: 21.2.1 Cells of the Innate Immune Response

This section details the primary cells involved in the rapid, non-specific innate immune response, focusing on phagocytes and natural killer cells.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Phagocytes:** Cells that engulf and destroy particles, debris, or pathogens via **phagocytosis**. They are a fast-acting, first line of defense once barriers are breached.
    *   Mechanism: Engulf target into a **phagosome**, which fuses with a **lysosome** for enzymatic destruction. (Some bacteria like *Mycobacteria tuberculosis* are resistant).
    *   Major Types: Macrophages, Neutrophils, Dendritic Cells.

*   **Macrophages:**
    *   Versatile, amoeboid phagocytes derived from monocytes.
    *   Move through tissues, act as sentinels, and are often the first defenders.
    *   Participate in both innate and adaptive immunity (e.g., as antigen-presenting cells).
    *   Found throughout tissues, either free-roaming or fixed (e.g., in lymph nodes).
    *   Tissue-specific names: Kupffer cells (liver), histiocytes (connective tissue), alveolar macrophages (lungs).
    *   Type: Agranulocyte (few/no cytoplasmic granules).

*   **Neutrophils:**
    *   Phagocytic cells attracted from the bloodstream to infection sites via chemotaxis.
    *   Act as rapid reinforcements during inflammation.
    *   Primary pathogen-killing cells of the innate inflammatory response, but may also play roles in adaptive immunity.
    *   Type: Granulocyte (contain cytoplasmic granules with vasoactive mediators like histamine).

*   **Monocytes:**
    *   Circulating precursor cells in the blood.
    *   Differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells upon migrating into tissues, often attracted by inflammatory signals.
    *   Type: Agranulocyte.

*   **Natural Killer (NK) Cells:**
    *   Type of lymphocyte involved in the innate immune response.
    *   Function: Induce **apoptosis** (programmed cell death) in cells infected with intracellular pathogens (viruses, some bacteria) or tumor cells.
    *   Recognition: Mechanisms not fully understood but involve surface receptors detecting abnormal cells.
    *   Killing Mechanisms:
        1.  **Fas Ligand:** NK cells express Fas ligand on their surface, which binds to the Fas molecule on the target cell, triggering apoptosis.
        2.  **Perforins and Granzymes:** NK cell granules release **perforins** (proteins forming pores in target cell membranes) and **granzymes** (protein-digesting enzymes entering via pores to trigger apoptosis intracellularly). Effective against virally infected cells, preventing release of new viruses.

# Summary: Chapter 21 Review - The Lymphatic and Immune System

This chapter review summarizes the key concepts regarding the anatomy and function of the lymphatic and immune systems.

## Key Concepts Recapped:

*   **21.1 Anatomy:**
    *   Lymphatic system components: Lymphatic vessels, lymph, lymph nodes, thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymphoid nodules (MALT, tonsils).
    *   Functions: Fluid return, fat transport, immune surveillance.
    *   Lymphocyte maturation: B cells in bone marrow, T cells in thymus (primary organs).
    *   Immune responses initiated in secondary organs (lymph nodes, spleen, nodules).
*   **21.2 Barrier Defenses and Innate Immunity:**
    *   Barriers: Skin, mucous membranes, secretions (physical/chemical blocks).
    *   Innate Response: Rapid, non-specific.
        *   Cells: Phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils), NK cells, mast cells.
        *   Soluble factors: Cytokines (interferons), complement system.
        *   Processes: Inflammation (redness, heat, swelling, pain), fever.
*   **21.3 Adaptive Immunity - T cells:**
    *   Cell-mediated immunity.
    *   T cell types: Helper T (T<sub>H</sub>/CD4+), Cytotoxic T (T<sub>C</sub>/CD8+), Regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>), Memory T.
    *   Antigen Presentation: MHC I (endogenous antigens, recognized by T<sub>C</sub>), MHC II (exogenous antigens, recognized by T<sub>H</sub>).
    *   T cell activation requires TCR binding to antigen-MHC complex and co-stimulation.
    *   T<sub>H</sub> cells orchestrate responses; T<sub>C</sub> cells kill infected/abnormal cells.
*   **21.4 Adaptive Immunity - B cells and Antibodies:**
    *   Humoral immunity.
    *   B cells recognize intact antigens via BCRs.
    *   Activation (often T cell-dependent) leads to plasma cells (secrete antibodies) and memory B cells.
    *   Antibody (Immunoglobulin - Ig) classes: IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD, each with specific structures and functions (neutralization, opsonization, complement activation, ADCC, etc.).
*   **21.5 Immune Response Against Pathogens:**
    *   Coordinated innate and adaptive responses tailored to pathogen type (extracellular/intracellular bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites).
    *   Pathogens employ various evasion strategies (capsules, antigenic variation, immunosuppression).
*   **21.6 Immune System Disorders:**
    *   Immunodeficiencies: Primary (genetic) or Secondary (acquired, e.g., HIV/AIDS).
    *   Hypersensitivities (Types I-IV): Over-reactions to harmless antigens (allergies, transfusion reactions, immune complexes, DTH).
    *   Autoimmunity: Loss of self-tolerance, immune system attacks own tissues (e.g., Type 1 diabetes, RA, SLE).
*   **21.7 Transplantation and Cancer Immunology:**
    *   Transplant rejection: Immune response (mainly T cells) against foreign MHC (HLA) molecules on grafts. Minimized by HLA matching and immunosuppression. GvHD is a complication of bone marrow transplants.
    *   Cancer Immunology: Immune surveillance can eliminate cancer cells. Tumors express antigens but can evade immune attack. Immunotherapies aim to boost anti-cancer immunity (checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells).

The lymphatic and immune systems work together to protect the body from pathogens and abnormal cells, involving complex interactions between innate and adaptive components.

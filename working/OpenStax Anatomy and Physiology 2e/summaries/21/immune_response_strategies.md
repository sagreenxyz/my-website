# Summary: Immune Response Strategies Against Pathogens

This document outlines the primary strategies employed by the innate and adaptive immune systems to combat different classes of pathogens.

## General Mechanisms:

*   **Barrier Defenses:** Physical (skin, mucous membranes, cilia) and chemical (acid, lysozyme, mucus) prevention of entry. (21.2)
*   **Phagocytosis:** Engulfment and destruction of pathogens by macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. (21.2.1)
*   **Inflammation:** Localized response (redness, heat, swelling, pain) involving vasodilation, increased permeability, and recruitment of immune cells (e.g., neutrophils) to contain infection and initiate repair. Mediated by histamine, cytokines, etc. (21.2)
*   **Complement System:** Plasma proteins activated via alternate (innate) or classical (adaptive) pathways leading to: (21.2.3)
    *   **Opsonization:** Tagging pathogens (C3b) for phagocytosis.
    *   **Chemotaxis:** Attracting phagocytes (C3a).
    *   **Lysis:** Forming Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) to puncture pathogen membranes.
*   **Natural Killer (NK) Cells:** Innate lymphocytes inducing apoptosis in virus-infected or tumor cells via Fas ligand or perforin/granzyme release. (21.2.1)
*   **Interferons:** Cytokines released by virus-infected cells to induce antiviral states in neighboring cells. (21.2.3)
*   **Antibody-Mediated Responses (Humoral Immunity):** (21.4)
    *   **Neutralization:** Antibodies block pathogen binding sites.
    *   **Agglutination/Precipitation:** Clumping pathogens/soluble antigens for easier clearance.
    *   **Opsonization:** IgG coating enhances phagocytosis.
    *   **Complement Activation:** IgM/IgG initiate classical pathway.
    *   **Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC):** Antibodies (IgG/IgE) bind target cells, allowing NK cells or eosinophils to kill them.
*   **T Cell-Mediated Responses (Cellular Immunity):** (21.3)
    *   **Helper T cells (T<sub>H</sub>):** Orchestrate responses by releasing cytokines to activate B cells, T<sub>C</sub> cells, and macrophages. Recognize antigen on MHC II.
    *   **Cytotoxic T cells (T<sub>C</sub>):** Kill infected host cells displaying antigen on MHC I via perforin/granzyme release.
*   **Immunological Memory:** Faster, stronger secondary response upon re-exposure due to memory B and T cells. (21.3, 21.4)

## Strategies by Pathogen Type: (21.5)

*   **Extracellular Bacteria:**
    *   **Innate:** Complement (MAC, opsonization), phagocytosis (neutrophils, macrophages), inflammation.
    *   **Adaptive:** Primarily **Humoral Immunity**. Antibodies (IgM, IgG) neutralize toxins, opsonize, activate complement, agglutinate. T<sub>H</sub> cells activate B cells and macrophages.
*   **Intracellular Bacteria (e.g., *Listeria*, *Mycobacterium*):**
    *   **Innate:** Phagocytosis (often resisted), NK cells.
    *   **Adaptive:** Primarily **Cell-Mediated Immunity**. T<sub>H</sub>1 cells activate macrophages to enhance killing. T<sub>C</sub> cells kill infected host cells.
*   **Viruses:**
    *   **Innate:** Interferons (Type I), NK cells (kill infected cells).
    *   **Adaptive:** Crucial for clearance.
        *   **Humoral:** Antibodies (IgA at mucosa, IgG/IgM in blood) neutralize viruses extracellularly.
        *   **Cell-mediated:** **T<sub>C</sub> cells** kill infected host cells presenting viral antigens on MHC I. T<sub>H</sub> cells support T<sub>C</sub> and B cell responses.
*   **Fungi:**
    *   **Innate:** Phagocytosis (neutrophils, macrophages), complement.
    *   **Adaptive:** T<sub>H</sub>1-mediated responses activating phagocytes appear important.
*   **Parasites (Protozoa & Helminths):**
    *   **Protozoa:** Phagocytosis, T<sub>C</sub> cells (intracellular stages), antibodies.
    *   **Helminths (Worms):** Often too large for phagocytosis. IgE antibodies bind worms, **eosinophils** bind IgE and release toxic granules (ADCC). Mast cell degranulation (via IgE) contributes. T<sub>H</sub>2 responses dominate.

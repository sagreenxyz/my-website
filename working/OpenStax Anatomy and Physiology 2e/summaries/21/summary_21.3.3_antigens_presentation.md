# Summary: 21.3.3 Antigens, Processing, and Presentation

This section describes antigens, how they are processed, and how they are presented to T cells via Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Antigens:**
    *   Usually large, complex molecules associated with pathogens.
    *   Contain multiple **antigenic determinants (epitopes)** - small regions (e.g., ~6 amino acids or 1-2 sugar moieties) that bind to immune receptors (like TCRs).
    *   **Protein antigens:** Complex 3D shapes, important for responses to viruses and worms.
    *   **Carbohydrate antigens:** Less diverse, found on bacterial walls, RBCs (ABO antigens).
    *   Specificity is based on the shape interaction between the epitope and the receptor's antigen-binding site.

*   **T Cell Antigen Recognition:**
    *   T cells **do not** recognize free-floating or intact cell-bound antigens directly.
    *   They only recognize processed antigen fragments presented on the surface of other cells by **Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)** molecules.

*   **Antigen Processing and Presentation:**
    1.  **Antigen Processing:** Internalized antigens are enzymatically cleaved into smaller fragments inside the cell.
    2.  **Antigen Presentation:** These fragments associate with MHC molecules within the cell and are then transported to the cell surface. The T cell receptor (TCR) recognizes the combined complex of the MHC molecule and the antigen fragment.
    *   **Peptide-binding cleft:** The groove on the MHC molecule where the antigen fragment sits.

*   **Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Molecules:**
    *   Encoded by a cluster of genes (the MHC).
    *   Bring processed antigen to the cell surface.
    *   Two main types: MHC Class I and MHC Class II.

*   **MHC Class I Pathway (Endogenous Antigens):**
    *   Presents antigens originating *inside* the cell (e.g., viral proteins, intracellular bacteria proteins, tumor antigens).
    *   Processing: Antigens cleaved by the **proteasome** in the cytosol.
    *   Transport: Fragments moved into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the **TAP system**.
    *   Loading: Fragments bind to MHC Class I molecules in the ER.
    *   Display: MHC I-antigen complex transported to the cell surface.
    *   Location: Expressed on **almost all nucleated cells**.
    *   Recognition: Presents to **Cytotoxic T cells (T<sub>C</sub>, CD8+)**, leading to the killing of the presenting cell if recognized as infected/abnormal.

*   **MHC Class II Pathway (Exogenous Antigens):**
    *   Presents antigens originating *outside* the cell (e.g., extracellular bacteria, fungi, parasites engulfed by the cell).
    *   Processing: Antigens internalized via endocytosis into vesicles.
    *   Loading: Vesicle fuses with another vesicle containing pre-formed MHC Class II molecules; fragments bind to MHC II.
    *   Display: MHC II-antigen complex transported to the cell surface.
    *   Location: Expressed only on **"professional" Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs)**.
    *   Recognition: Presents to **Helper T cells (T<sub>H</sub>, CD4+)**, leading to activation of T<sub>H</sub> cells to help orchestrate the immune response.

*   **Professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs):** Express MHC Class II (and Class I).
    *   **Macrophages:** Phagocytose pathogens; present antigens to T<sub>H</sub> cells, which release cytokines enhancing phagocytosis. Found at infection sites (skin, mucosa).
    *   **Dendritic Cells:** Phagocytose pathogens in tissues; primary role is to migrate to regional lymph nodes and present antigens to initiate T cell responses there.
    *   **B Cells:** Internalize antigens via their B cell receptors (BCRs); present antigens to T<sub>H</sub> cells, which is necessary for T cell-dependent antibody responses.

## Summary Table of Antigen-Presenting Cells:

| MHC      | Cell type     | Phagocytic?        | Function                                                     |
| :------- | :------------ | :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class I  | Most Nucleated Cells | No                 | Stimulates cytotoxic T cell (T<sub>C</sub>) immune response        |
| Class II | Macrophage    | Yes                | Stimulates phagocytosis; presents at infection site to T<sub>H</sub> |
| Class II | Dendritic Cell| Yes (in tissues)   | Brings antigens to lymph nodes; presents to T<sub>H</sub>        |
| Class II | B Cell        | Yes (via BCR)      | Stimulates antibody secretion (with T<sub>H</sub> help)          |

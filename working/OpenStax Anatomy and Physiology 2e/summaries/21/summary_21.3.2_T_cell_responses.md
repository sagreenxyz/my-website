# Summary: 21.3.2 T Cell-Mediated Immune Responses & Receptor

This section introduces the central role of T lymphocytes in controlling adaptive immunity and describes their antigen receptor.

## Key Concepts:

*   **T Cells as Controllers:** T lymphocytes (T cells) are primary controllers of the adaptive immune response. They directly manage multiple immune responses and also regulate B cell responses. Key decisions on how to attack pathogens often occur at the T cell level.
*   **T Cell Receptor (TCR):**
    *   T cells recognize antigens using a two-chain protein receptor.
    *   The most common type is the **alpha-beta (αβ) T cell receptor**.
    *   **Structure:** Each chain (alpha and beta) has two domains:
        *   **Variable Region Domain:** Furthest from the cell membrane. Its amino acid sequence varies greatly between different TCRs, forming the basis for recognizing diverse antigens.
        *   **Constant Region Domain:** Closer to the cell membrane, with less variation.
    *   **Antigen-Binding Site:** Formed by the terminal ends of the variable regions of both the alpha and beta chains. The combined amino acid sequences determine the receptor's specific antigen-binding capability.
    *   **Specificity:** Each T cell produces only one type of TCR, making it specific for a single particular antigen.

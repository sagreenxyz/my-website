# Summary: 21.4 The Adaptive Immune Response: B-lymphocytes and Antibodies

This section describes B lymphocytes (B cells) and their role in humoral immunity, primarily through the production of antibodies.

## Key Concepts:

*   **B Lymphocytes (B cells):** Originate and mature in the bone marrow. Responsible for humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity.
*   **B Cell Receptor (BCR):** A membrane-bound antibody molecule (IgM/IgD) on the B cell surface. Each B cell has unique BCRs specific for one antigen.
*   **Antigen Recognition:** B cells can recognize and bind to *intact*, unprocessed antigens in the extracellular fluid via their BCRs.
*   **B Cell Activation:**
    *   **T cell-independent activation:** Some antigens (e.g., polysaccharides with repeating epitopes) can directly activate B cells without T helper cell involvement. This response is generally weaker and lacks memory.
    *   **T cell-dependent activation:** Most protein antigens require help from T helper (T<sub>H</sub>) cells for full B cell activation, class switching, and memory formation.
        1.  B cell binds antigen via BCR, internalizes and processes it.
        2.  Presents antigen fragments on MHC Class II molecules.
        3.  A T<sub>H</sub> cell (already activated by an APC presenting the same antigen) recognizes the antigen-MHC II complex on the B cell.
        4.  The T<sub>H</sub> cell provides co-stimulation (e.g., via CD40L binding to CD40) and releases cytokines, fully activating the B cell.
*   **Clonal Expansion and Differentiation:** Activated B cells proliferate (clonal expansion) and differentiate into:
    *   **Plasma Cells:** Antibody factories. They have extensive endoplasmic reticulum and secrete large quantities of antibodies specific for the activating antigen. They are relatively short-lived.
    *   **Memory B Cells:** Long-lived cells that remain in the body. They provide immunological memory for humoral immunity, allowing for a rapid and enhanced response (secondary response) upon subsequent exposure to the same antigen.

## Antibodies (Immunoglobulins - Ig):

*   Proteins secreted by plasma cells that bind specifically to the antigen that triggered their production.
*   **Structure:** Typically Y-shaped molecules composed of four polypeptide chains (two identical heavy chains, two identical light chains) linked by disulfide bonds.
    *   **Variable Region:** The tips of the "Y" arms, form the antigen-binding sites. Specificity is determined here.
    *   **Constant Region:** The stem and lower part of the arms. Determines the antibody class and effector function (how the antibody interacts with other immune components).
*   **Antibody Classes (Isotypes):** Determined by the heavy chain constant region.
    *   **IgM:** Pentamer (usually). First antibody produced during a primary response. Effective at activating complement and agglutinating antigens. BCR is monomeric IgM/IgD.
    *   **IgG:** Monomer. Most abundant antibody in blood and tissue fluid. Crosses the placenta. Key player in secondary responses. Activates complement, opsonizes pathogens, mediates ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity).
    *   **IgA:** Dimer (usually in secretions), monomer in blood. Found in mucus, saliva, tears, breast milk. Protects mucosal surfaces by neutralizing pathogens.
    *   **IgD:** Monomer. Primarily found on the surface of naive B cells as a BCR. Function not fully understood.
    *   **IgE:** Monomer. Binds to mast cells and basophils. Involved in allergic reactions and defense against parasitic worms. Triggers histamine release upon antigen binding.
*   **Antibody Functions (How they help eliminate pathogens):**
    *   **Neutralization:** Binding to toxins or viruses, preventing them from interacting with host cells.
    *   **Agglutination:** Clumping pathogens together, making them easier to phagocytose.
    *   **Precipitation:** Making soluble antigens insoluble, facilitating phagocytosis.
    *   **Opsonization:** Coating pathogens (especially IgG), enhancing phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils.
    *   **Complement Activation:** (IgM, IgG) Initiating the classical complement pathway, leading to pathogen lysis and inflammation.
    *   **Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC):** (IgG) Antibodies bind to infected cells or parasites; NK cells then bind to the antibody constant region and kill the target cell.

Humoral immunity mediated by B cells and antibodies is crucial for combating extracellular pathogens (bacteria, toxins, viruses in extracellular phase) and provides long-lasting immunological memory.

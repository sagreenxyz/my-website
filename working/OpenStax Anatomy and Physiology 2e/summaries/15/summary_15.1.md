# Summary: 15.1 Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System

This section introduces the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) as the involuntary motor division of the PNS, controlling visceral functions. It details the distinct anatomy and general functions of its two main branches: the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions.

## Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) Overview:

*   **Function:** Regulates subconscious activities of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands to maintain homeostasis. Also called involuntary nervous system or general visceral motor system.
*   **Comparison with Somatic Nervous System (SNS):**
    *   **Effectors:** SNS = skeletal muscle; ANS = cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, glands.
    *   **Efferent Pathways:** SNS = single, heavily myelinated axon from CNS to effector; ANS = two-neuron chain (preganglionic and postganglionic neurons) connected at an autonomic ganglion. Preganglionic axon lightly myelinated; postganglionic axon unmyelinated.
    *   **Neurotransmitters:** SNS = Acetylcholine (ACh), always excitatory; ANS = ACh (preganglionic, parasympathetic postganglionic) and Norepinephrine (NE) (most sympathetic postganglionic), can be excitatory or inhibitory depending on receptor.
*   **Overlap:** Higher brain centers regulate both systems. Most spinal nerves and many cranial nerves contain both somatic and autonomic fibers. Adaptations usually involve both skeletal muscle and visceral organs.

## Parasympathetic Division ("Rest and Digest"):

*   **Function:** Promotes maintenance activities and conserves body energy. Directs digestion, diuresis, defecation. Lowers blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate. Pupils constricted, lenses accommodated for close vision.
*   **Origin:** Craniosacral division - preganglionic fibers arise from brainstem (CN III, VII, IX, X) and sacral spinal cord (S2-S4).
*   **Ganglia:** Located in or near target organs (terminal ganglia).
*   **Fiber Length:** Long preganglionic fibers, short postganglionic fibers.
*   **Neurotransmitter:** ACh released by both preganglionic and postganglionic fibers (cholinergic fibers).

## Sympathetic Division ("Fight or Flight"):

*   **Function:** Mobilizes body during activity, stress, emergency, excitement, exercise. Increases heart rate, blood pressure. Dilates bronchioles. Stimulates glucose release from liver. Redirects blood flow to skeletal muscles and heart, away from digestive/urinary tracts. Pupils dilated. Causes sweating.
*   **Origin:** Thoracolumbar division - preganglionic fibers arise from thoracic and lumbar spinal cord segments (T1-L2). Cell bodies in lateral horns.
*   **Ganglia:** Located close to spinal cord.
    *   **Sympathetic Trunk (Paravertebral) Ganglia:** Chain alongside vertebral column. Preganglionic fibers enter via white rami communicantes, synapse at same level, ascend/descend trunk, or pass through to synapse in collateral ganglia. Postganglionic fibers exit via gray rami communicantes to join spinal nerves or form direct visceral nerves.
    *   **Collateral (Prevertebral) Ganglia:** Anterior to vertebral column (e.g., celiac, superior/inferior mesenteric). Synapse site for splanchnic nerves serving abdominal/pelvic organs.
*   **Fiber Length:** Short preganglionic fibers, long postganglionic fibers. Extensive branching allows widespread effects.
*   **Neurotransmitter:** ACh released by preganglionic fibers. NE released by most postganglionic fibers (adrenergic fibers). (Exception: ACh released at sweat glands). Adrenal medulla acts like sympathetic ganglion, releasing NE and epinephrine into blood.

Most visceral organs receive dual innervation from both divisions, allowing fine control. The divisions usually have antagonistic effects.

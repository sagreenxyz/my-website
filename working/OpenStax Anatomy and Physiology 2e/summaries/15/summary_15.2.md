# Summary: 15.2 Autonomic Reflexes and Homeostasis

This section describes how the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) operates through visceral reflexes to maintain homeostasis, and discusses the neurotransmitters and receptors involved.

## Visceral Reflexes:

*   Similar components to somatic reflexes: receptor, sensory neuron, integration center, motor neuron, effector.
*   **Key Differences:**
    *   Integration center may be spinal cord, brainstem, or autonomic ganglia.
    *   Motor pathway involves a two-neuron chain (preganglionic, postganglionic).
    *   Effectors are smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, or glands.
*   **Examples:** Reflexes regulating heart rate, blood pressure (baroreceptor reflex), respiration, digestion (enteric nervous system reflexes), urination (micturition reflex), pupillary light reflex.
*   Visceral sensory neurons monitor stretch, temperature, chemical changes, irritation within visceral organs. Input travels via cranial and spinal nerves.

## Neurotransmitters and Receptors:

*   ANS effects depend on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor on the target cell.
*   **Cholinergic Fibers:** Release Acetylcholine (ACh).
    *   All ANS preganglionic axons.
    *   All parasympathetic postganglionic axons.
    *   Sympathetic postganglionic axons innervating sweat glands.
*   **Adrenergic Fibers:** Release Norepinephrine (NE).
    *   Most sympathetic postganglionic axons.
*   **Receptors for ACh (Cholinergic Receptors):**
    *   **Nicotinic Receptors:**
        *   Location: All postganglionic neuron cell bodies (in autonomic ganglia), adrenal medulla cells, neuromuscular junctions of skeletal muscle.
        *   Effect: Always excitatory (opens ion channels, depolarizes).
    *   **Muscarinic Receptors:**
        *   Location: All effector cells stimulated by parasympathetic postganglionic cholinergic fibers (smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, glands).
        *   Effect: Can be excitatory or inhibitory, depending on target organ receptor subtype (e.g., excitatory in gut smooth muscle, inhibitory in cardiac muscle). Act via G proteins.
*   **Receptors for NE (Adrenergic Receptors):** Found on effector cells stimulated by sympathetic postganglionic adrenergic fibers. Act via G proteins.
    *   **Alpha (α) Receptors:**
        *   α1: Typically excitatory (e.g., constricts blood vessels, dilates pupils).
        *   α2: Typically inhibitory (e.g., inhibits NE release, inhibits insulin secretion).
    *   **Beta (β) Receptors:**
        *   β1: Primarily in heart; increases heart rate and contractility. Also in kidneys (renin release).
        *   β2: Primarily inhibitory; relaxes smooth muscle (e.g., dilates bronchioles, relaxes uterus, dilates blood vessels serving heart, liver, skeletal muscle).
        *   β3: Primarily in adipose tissue; stimulates lipolysis.

## ANS Control of Homeostasis:

*   **Dual Innervation:** Most organs receive input from both sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions, which usually exert antagonistic effects (e.g., heart rate, pupil size, gut motility). Allows precise control.
*   **Sympathetic Tone (Vasomotor Tone):** Continuous partial constriction of blood vessels maintained by sympathetic division. Allows regulation of blood pressure by increasing or decreasing firing rate.
*   **Parasympathetic Tone:** Dominance of parasympathetic effects at rest (e.g., slows heart, dictates normal digestive/urinary activity). Can be overridden by sympathetic system during stress.
*   **Cooperative Effects:** Divisions work together (e.g., parasympathetic causes penile erection, sympathetic causes ejaculation).
*   **Unique Sympathetic Roles:** Controls adrenal medulla, sweat glands, arrector pili muscles, kidneys, most blood vessels (receive only sympathetic fibers). Regulates body temperature, renin release, metabolic effects (glucose release, increases metabolic rate).

The ANS maintains homeostasis through visceral reflexes and the balanced, often antagonistic, actions of its sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions, mediated by specific neurotransmitters and receptors.

# Summary: 10.6 Exercise and Muscle Performance

This section examines how exercise affects skeletal muscle tissue, leading to adaptations that improve muscle performance, strength, and endurance.

## Effects of Exercise on Muscle:

*   Regular exercise leads to increased muscle efficiency, endurance, strength, and resistance to fatigue.
*   Adaptations depend on the type of exercise: aerobic (endurance) or resistance (strength).

## Aerobic (Endurance) Exercise:

*   **Definition:** Activities like jogging, swimming, biking; low-intensity but long-duration.
*   **Primary Muscle Fibers Used:** Slow oxidative (SO) fibers.
*   **Adaptations:**
    *   **Increased Capillaries:** More blood vessels surrounding muscle fibers, improving oxygen and nutrient delivery and waste removal.
    *   **Increased Mitochondria:** More mitochondria within muscle fibers, enhancing ATP production via aerobic respiration.
    *   **Increased Myoglobin:** More myoglobin synthesized, increasing oxygen storage capacity within fibers.
    *   **Metabolic Changes:** Increased efficiency of metabolic pathways.
*   **Result:** Greater endurance, strength, and resistance to fatigue. Does *not* typically cause significant muscle hypertrophy (increase in size).
*   **Benefits:** Improves cardiovascular health, respiratory function, and overall metabolism.

## Resistance Exercise:

*   **Definition:** Activities like weightlifting or isometric exercises; high-intensity, short-duration efforts against resistance.
*   **Primary Muscle Fibers Used:** Fast glycolytic (FG) and Fast oxidative-glycolytic (FOG) fibers.
*   **Adaptations:**
    *   **Muscle Hypertrophy:** Increase in the *size* of existing muscle fibers (primarily FG fibers). This occurs due to increased synthesis of actin and myosin myofilaments, resulting in larger myofibrils. The number of muscle fibers generally does not increase significantly (hyperplasia is limited).
    *   **Increased Glycogen Stores:** More glycogen stored within fibers for anaerobic energy production.
    *   **Increased Connective Tissue:** Strengthening of tendons and ligaments.
*   **Result:** Increased muscle size (hypertrophy), strength, and power.

## Muscle Fatigue:

*   **Definition:** Physiological inability to contract effectively despite continued stimulation.
*   **Causes:** Complex and not fully understood, but contributing factors include:
    *   **Ionic Imbalances:** Accumulation of K⁺ in the ECF, altering membrane potential.
    *   **Accumulation of Inorganic Phosphate (Pi):** From ATP hydrolysis; may interfere with Ca²⁺ release and cross-bridge function.
    *   **ATP Depletion:** Less likely in moderate exercise, but possible in extreme exertion.
    *   **Lactic Acid Accumulation:** Contributes to H⁺ buildup, potentially interfering with enzymes and Ca²⁺ binding (role debated).
    *   **Central Fatigue:** Psychological factors, changes in CNS drive.

## Oxygen Debt (Excess Post-exercise Oxygen Consumption - EPOC):

*   The extra amount of oxygen the body must take in after strenuous exercise to restore pre-exercise conditions.
*   Used to:
    *   Replenish oxygen reserves (myoglobin, hemoglobin).
    *   Convert accumulated lactic acid back to pyruvic acid or glucose (in liver).
    *   Replenish ATP and creatine phosphate stores.
    *   Restore ion concentrations.
    *   Support elevated metabolic rate due to increased body temperature.

## Disuse Atrophy:

*   Decrease in muscle size and strength due to inactivity or immobilization. Muscle fibers shrink, and the muscle loses tone. Can be reversed with exercise if initiated promptly.

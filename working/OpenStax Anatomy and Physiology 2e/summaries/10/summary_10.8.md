# Summary: 10.8 Smooth Muscle

This section describes the structure, function, and regulation of smooth muscle tissue, found primarily in the walls of hollow organs and tubes.

## Structure of Smooth Muscle:

*   **Cells:** Spindle-shaped, uninucleated (one central nucleus), much smaller than skeletal muscle fibers.
*   **Arrangement:** Typically arranged in sheets (often longitudinal and circular layers).
*   **Connective Tissue:** Endomysium present between cells.
*   **Myofilaments:**
    *   Contain actin and myosin filaments, but *not* arranged in sarcomeres, hence the lack of striations ("smooth" appearance).
    *   Actin filaments are anchored to **dense bodies** (analogous to Z-discs) within the cytoplasm and attached to the sarcolemma.
    *   Intermediate filaments also attach to dense bodies, forming a cytoskeletal network.
*   **Sarcolemma:** Contains caveolae (shallow invaginations, may act like T-tubules).
*   **Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR):** Less developed than in skeletal muscle; stores some Ca²⁺, but most Ca²⁺ for contraction comes from extracellular fluid.
*   **Gap Junctions:** Often present between cells, allowing electrical coupling and coordinated contraction (functional syncytium).

## Contraction Mechanism:

*   **Trigger:** Rise in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration (primarily from ECF, some from SR).
*   **Calcium Binding:** Ca²⁺ binds to **calmodulin** (regulatory protein, analogous to troponin).
*   **Enzyme Activation:** Ca²⁺-calmodulin complex activates **myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)**.
*   **Myosin Phosphorylation:** MLCK phosphorylates myosin light chains on the myosin heads.
*   **Cross-Bridge Cycling:** Phosphorylated myosin heads bind to actin and undergo cross-bridge cycling, pulling on actin filaments.
*   **Cell Shortening:** Actin filaments pull on dense bodies, causing the entire cell to shorten and twist in a corkscrew manner.
*   **Relaxation:** Requires Ca²⁺ detachment from calmodulin, inactivation of MLCK, and dephosphorylation of myosin by **myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP)**.

## Regulation of Contraction:

*   **Neural Control:** Autonomic nervous system (ANS) fibers release neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine, norepinephrine) onto smooth muscle cells. Response (excitation or inhibition) depends on the receptor type. Varicosities release neurotransmitter over a wider area.
*   **Hormonal Control:** Various hormones and local chemical factors can stimulate or inhibit contraction (e.g., oxytocin, angiotensin, histamine, low O₂, high CO₂, pH changes).
*   **Stretch:** Some smooth muscle (especially single-unit) responds to stretch by contracting (stress-relaxation response allows organs like the stomach and bladder to fill).

## Types of Smooth Muscle:

*   **Single-Unit (Visceral) Smooth Muscle:**
    *   Most common type (walls of hollow organs).
    *   Cells connected by gap junctions, contract as a coordinated unit (functional syncytium).
    *   Often exhibits spontaneous electrical activity (pacemaker potentials) and responds to stretch.
*   **Multi-Unit Smooth Muscle:**
    *   Cells are structurally independent, few gap junctions.
    *   Richly supplied by nerve endings; each cell or small group contracts independently.
    *   Allows for fine, graded control.
    *   Found in large airways, large arteries, arrector pili muscles, internal eye muscles (iris).

## Functional Characteristics:

*   Slow, sustained contractions.
*   Resistant to fatigue.
*   Can maintain prolonged tone.
*   Can stretch significantly while maintaining ability to contract.

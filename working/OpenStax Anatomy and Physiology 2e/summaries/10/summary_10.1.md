# Summary: 10.1 Overview of Muscle Tissues

This section introduces the three types of muscle tissue found in the body—skeletal, cardiac, and smooth—highlighting their key characteristics, locations, and general functions.

## General Characteristics of Muscle Tissue:

All muscle tissues share four main properties:

1.  **Excitability (Responsiveness):** Ability to receive and respond to stimuli (e.g., neurotransmitters, hormones) by changing membrane potential.
2.  **Contractility:** Ability to shorten forcibly when adequately stimulated. This is the defining property of muscle tissue.
3.  **Extensibility:** Ability to be stretched or extended beyond resting length.
4.  **Elasticity:** Ability to recoil and resume resting length after stretching.

## Functions of Muscle Tissue:

*   **Producing Movement:** Locomotion (skeletal), manipulating objects (skeletal), pumping blood (cardiac), propelling substances through hollow organs (smooth).
*   **Maintaining Posture and Body Position:** Skeletal muscles constantly adjust to counteract gravity.
*   **Stabilizing Joints:** Muscle tendons crossing joints provide stability.
*   **Generating Heat:** Muscle contraction produces heat, important for maintaining normal body temperature (especially skeletal muscle).
*   **Other Functions:** Protect organs (skeletal), form valves (smooth), control pupil size (smooth), cause "goosebumps" (smooth - arrector pili).

## Types of Muscle Tissue:

1.  **Skeletal Muscle Tissue:**
    *   **Location:** Attached primarily to bones (via tendons).
    *   **Appearance:** Long, cylindrical cells (fibers); multinucleated; obvious striations (striped pattern).
    *   **Control:** Voluntary (conscious control via somatic nervous system).
    *   **Function:** Body movement, posture, heat generation. Contracts rapidly but tires easily.
2.  **Cardiac Muscle Tissue:**
    *   **Location:** Only in the walls of the heart (myocardium).
    *   **Appearance:** Branching cells; typically uninucleated (or binucleated); striated; connected by intercalated discs (containing gap junctions and desmosomes).
    *   **Control:** Involuntary (autonomic nervous system, hormones, intrinsic pacemaker system).
    *   **Function:** Pumps blood through the circulatory system. Contracts at a fairly steady rate set by the pacemaker; resistant to fatigue.
3.  **Smooth Muscle Tissue:**
    *   **Location:** Walls of hollow visceral organs (e.g., stomach, bladder, intestines), blood vessels, airways, iris of the eye, arrector pili muscles.
    *   **Appearance:** Spindle-shaped cells; uninucleated; no striations ("smooth"). Arranged in sheets.
    *   **Control:** Involuntary (autonomic nervous system, hormones, local chemical factors, stretch).
    *   **Function:** Propels substances along internal passageways (peristalsis), controls vessel diameter, regulates pupil size. Contractions are slow and sustained; resistant to fatigue.

# Summary: 10.3 Muscle Fiber Contraction and Relaxation

This section details the molecular events that occur within a skeletal muscle fiber leading to contraction (sliding filament theory) and subsequent relaxation.

## Activation: The Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ)

*   Contraction is initiated by a signal from a motor neuron. (Covered in 10.2, but essential context).
*   Arrival of action potential (AP) at axon terminal -> ACh release -> ACh binds to receptors on sarcolemma -> Depolarization (End Plate Potential - EPP) -> AP generation on sarcolemma.

## Excitation-Contraction (E-C) Coupling:

*   The sequence of events linking the action potential on the sarcolemma to the activation of myofilaments.
1.  **AP Propagation:** The AP travels along the sarcolemma and down into the **T-tubules**.
2.  **Ca²⁺ Release:** The AP in the T-tubules triggers voltage-sensitive proteins (DHP receptors), which in turn cause **Ca²⁺ release channels (ryanodine receptors)** on the terminal cisternae of the **sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)** to open.
3.  **Ca²⁺ Flood:** Ca²⁺ ions flood from the SR into the sarcoplasm, significantly increasing intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration.

## The Sliding Filament Model of Contraction:

*   Describes how muscle fibers shorten when stimulated. Myosin heads pull actin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere.
*   **Role of Calcium:** In a relaxed muscle, **tropomyosin** blocks the myosin-binding sites on actin. When Ca²⁺ levels rise (due to E-C coupling), Ca²⁺ binds to **troponin**.
*   **Troponin-Tropomyosin Shift:** Ca²⁺ binding causes troponin to change shape, which pulls tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin, exposing them.
*   **Cross-Bridge Cycle:** Requires ATP.
    1.  **Cross-Bridge Formation:** Energized myosin head (with ADP + Pi bound) attaches to the exposed binding site on actin.
    2.  **Power Stroke:** ADP and Pi are released from the myosin head. The myosin head pivots and bends, pulling the actin filament toward the M-line.
    3.  **Cross-Bridge Detachment:** A new ATP molecule binds to the myosin head, causing it to detach from actin.
    4.  **Reactivation ("Cocking") of Myosin Head:** ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP + Pi by myosin ATPase. The energy released re-energizes and repositions the myosin head into the high-energy ("cocked") position, ready for another cycle.
*   **Result:** As long as Ca²⁺ and ATP are present, the cycle repeats, pulling actin filaments closer together, shortening the sarcomere, and thus the muscle fiber. H zones and I bands shorten, A bands stay the same length.

## Relaxation:

*   Occurs when the motor neuron stops firing.
1.  **ACh Breakdown:** Acetylcholinesterase breaks down ACh in the synaptic cleft.
2.  **Repolarization:** Sarcolemma repolarizes.
3.  **Ca²⁺ Reuptake:** Ca²⁺ channels on the SR close. **Ca²⁺-ATPase pumps** actively transport Ca²⁺ from the sarcoplasm back into the SR.
4.  **Tropomyosin Blockage:** As sarcoplasmic Ca²⁺ levels fall, Ca²⁺ detaches from troponin. Troponin returns to its original shape, allowing tropomyosin to slide back and cover the myosin-binding sites on actin.
5.  **Contraction Ends:** Cross-bridge cycling stops. The muscle fiber passively lengthens back to its resting state (aided by gravity or antagonistic muscles).

**Rigor Mortis:** Stiffening of muscles after death. Due to lack of ATP, myosin heads cannot detach from actin, leaving cross-bridges locked.

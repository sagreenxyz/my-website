# Summary: 10.7 Cardiac Muscle Tissue

This section focuses on the unique structure and function of cardiac muscle tissue, which forms the walls of the heart (myocardium).

## Structure of Cardiac Muscle:

*   **Cells (Cardiomyocytes):** Striated (due to sarcomere arrangement, similar to skeletal muscle), short, branched, and typically uninucleated (sometimes binucleated) with the nucleus located centrally.
*   **Intercalated Discs:** Specialized junctions connecting adjacent cardiomyocytes. Contain:
    *   **Desmosomes:** Anchor cells together, preventing separation during contraction.
    *   **Gap Junctions:** Allow ions to pass freely between cells, electrically coupling them. This enables the heart muscle to contract as a coordinated unit (functional syncytium).
*   **Myofilaments:** Actin and myosin arranged in sarcomeres, similar to skeletal muscle.
*   **T-Tubules:** Present, but wider and fewer than in skeletal muscle; located at Z-discs.
*   **Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR):** Simpler and less extensive than in skeletal muscle; stores Ca²⁺ but relies heavily on extracellular Ca²⁺ influx for contraction.
*   **Mitochondria:** Abundant (25-35% of cell volume) reflecting high aerobic respiration demands.

## Contraction Mechanism:

*   **Excitation-Contraction Coupling:** Similar to skeletal muscle but with key differences:
    1.  **Depolarization:** Action potential (AP) initiated by pacemaker cells spreads through gap junctions.
    2.  **Ca²⁺ Entry:** AP travels down T-tubules, opening voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels in the sarcolemma. Ca²⁺ enters from the extracellular fluid (ECF).
    3.  **Ca²⁺-Induced Ca²⁺ Release (CICR):** Ca²⁺ entering from ECF triggers the opening of Ca²⁺-release channels (ryanodine receptors) on the SR, releasing a larger amount of Ca²⁺ into the sarcoplasm.
    4.  **Cross-Bridge Formation:** Ca²⁺ binds to troponin, causing tropomyosin to move, exposing myosin-binding sites on actin. Cross-bridge cycling occurs (sliding filament mechanism).
*   **Relaxation:** Requires removal of Ca²⁺ from the sarcoplasm via Ca²⁺-ATPase pumps back into the SR and Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchangers (NCX) pumping Ca²⁺ out of the cell.

## Functional Characteristics:

*   **Involuntary Control:** Regulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hormones, but contracts intrinsically.
*   **Autorhythmicity:** Specialized pacemaker cells initiate electrical impulses spontaneously, setting the heart rate.
*   **Functional Syncytium:** Gap junctions allow rapid spread of electrical activity, ensuring the myocardium contracts as a unit (atria contract together, ventricles contract together).
*   **Long Absolute Refractory Period:** The period during which the cell cannot be re-stimulated is nearly as long as the contraction itself. This prevents tetanic contractions (sustained contraction), which is essential for the heart's pumping function.
*   **Aerobic Respiration:** Relies almost exclusively on aerobic metabolism for ATP production; highly resistant to fatigue under normal conditions but very dependent on oxygen supply.

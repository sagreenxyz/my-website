# Summary: 7.1 Divisions of the Skeletal System

This section introduces the two major divisions of the adult human skeleton: the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton.

*   **Skeletal System Overview:** The adult skeleton consists of 206 bones, along with cartilages, ligaments, and other connective tissues that connect them.
*   **Functions:** Provides support, protection for internal organs, allows movement (acting as levers for muscles), stores minerals (calcium, phosphorus), produces blood cells (hematopoiesis in red bone marrow), and stores fat (yellow bone marrow).
*   **Axial Skeleton:**
    *   Forms the central, vertical axis of the body.
    *   Includes bones of the skull, vertebral column, and thoracic cage.
    *   Consists of 80 bones in the adult.
    *   **Function:** Protects the brain, spinal cord, heart, and lungs; supports the head, neck, and trunk; provides attachment sites for muscles that move the head, neck, trunk, and for muscles involved in respiration.
    *   **Components:**
        *   **Skull (22 bones + 6 auditory ossicles + 1 hyoid bone):** Cranial bones (8) enclose the brain; Facial bones (14) form the face.
        *   **Vertebral Column (26 bones):** Cervical vertebrae (7), Thoracic vertebrae (12), Lumbar vertebrae (5), Sacrum (1, fused from 5), Coccyx (1, fused from 3-5). Encloses spinal cord.
        *   **Thoracic Cage (25 bones):** Sternum (1) and Ribs (24, 12 pairs). Protects thoracic organs.
*   **Appendicular Skeleton:**
    *   Consists of the bones of the upper and lower limbs, plus the bones of the pectoral (shoulder) and pelvic (hip) girdles that attach the limbs to the axial skeleton.
    *   Consists of 126 bones in the adult.
    *   **Function:** Primarily involved in locomotion (lower limbs) and manipulation of objects (upper limbs).
    *   **Components:**
        *   **Pectoral Girdles (4 bones):** Clavicle (2) and Scapula (2). Attach upper limbs to axial skeleton (sternum).
        *   **Upper Limbs (60 bones):** Humerus (2), Radius (2), Ulna (2), Carpals (16), Metacarpals (10), Phalanges (28).
        *   **Pelvic Girdle (2 bones):** Hip bones (2, each formed by fusion of ilium, ischium, pubis). Attach lower limbs to axial skeleton (sacrum).
        *   **Lower Limbs (60 bones):** Femur (2), Patella (2), Tibia (2), Fibula (2), Tarsals (14), Metatarsals (10), Phalanges (28).

The axial skeleton is fundamental for protecting vital organs and providing a central support structure for the body.

# Summary: 7.3 The Vertebral Column

This section details the structure, function, and regional characteristics of the vertebral column (spine).

*   **Overview:**
    *   Forms the central axis of the skeleton.
    *   Supports the head and trunk, protects the spinal cord, allows flexible movement, and serves as an attachment point for ribs and back muscles.
    *   Composed of 24 individual vertebrae, the sacrum, and the coccyx.
*   **Regions and Curvatures:**
    *   **Regions (Superior to Inferior):**
        *   **Cervical (C1-C7):** Neck region.
        *   **Thoracic (T1-T12):** Chest region; articulate with ribs.
        *   **Lumbar (L1-L5):** Lower back region.
        *   **Sacrum:** 5 fused vertebrae (S1-S5); articulates with hip bones.
        *   **Coccyx:** 3-5 fused vertebrae (Co1-Co4/5); tailbone.
    *   **Curvatures (Adult):**
        *   **Primary Curvatures (Present at birth, concave anteriorly):** Thoracic and Sacrococcygeal. Accommodate thoracic and abdominopelvic organs.
        *   **Secondary Curvatures (Develop after birth, convex anteriorly):** Cervical (develops when infant holds head up) and Lumbar (develops when infant walks). Help position body weight over the legs.
*   **General Structure of a Vertebra:**
    *   **Body (Centrum):** Anterior, weight-bearing part.
    *   **Vertebral Arch:** Posterior part; forms walls of vertebral foramen. Consists of:
        *   **Pedicles:** Short stalks projecting posteriorly from the body.
        *   **Laminae:** Flat plates forming the posterior roof of the arch.
    *   **Vertebral Foramen:** Opening enclosed by the body and arch; successive foramina form the vertebral canal housing the spinal cord.
    *   **Processes (for muscle/ligament attachment and articulation):**
        *   **Spinous Process:** Projects posteriorly from the junction of the laminae.
        *   **Transverse Processes (2):** Project laterally from the junction of pedicles and laminae.
        *   **Superior Articular Processes (2):** Project superiorly; articulate with inferior articular processes of vertebra above.
        *   **Inferior Articular Processes (2):** Project inferiorly; articulate with superior articular processes of vertebra below.
    *   **Intervertebral Foramina:** Lateral openings between adjacent vertebrae formed by notches on pedicles; allow passage of spinal nerves.
*   **Regional Characteristics:**
    *   **Cervical Vertebrae (C1-C7):** Smallest bodies, bifid spinous process (C2-C6), transverse foramina (for vertebral arteries).
        *   **Atlas (C1):** No body or spinous process; superior articular facets articulate with occipital condyles ("yes" motion).
        *   **Axis (C2):** Has Dens (odontoid process) projecting superiorly from body; acts as pivot for Atlas rotation ("no" motion).
    *   **Thoracic Vertebrae (T1-T12):** Heart-shaped body, long spinous process pointing inferiorly, costal facets on body and transverse processes for rib articulation.
    *   **Lumbar Vertebrae (L1-L5):** Largest bodies (support most weight), short/blunt spinous process projecting posteriorly, triangular vertebral foramen.
    *   **Sacrum:** Triangular bone formed by fusion of 5 vertebrae; features include sacral promontory, median sacral crest, sacral foramina, auricular surfaces (for sacroiliac joints).
    *   **Coccyx:** Small triangular bone formed by fusion of 3-5 rudimentary vertebrae.
*   **Intervertebral Discs:**
    *   Fibrocartilage pads between bodies of adjacent vertebrae (C2-Sacrum).
    *   Act as shock absorbers and allow slight movement.
    *   Composed of:
        *   **Annulus Fibrosus:** Outer ring of fibrocartilage.
        *   **Nucleus Pulposus:** Inner gelatinous core (remnant of notochord).

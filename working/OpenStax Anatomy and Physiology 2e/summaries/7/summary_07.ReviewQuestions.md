# Summary: Chapter 7 Review Questions

This section contains review questions designed to test comprehension of the key concepts covered in Chapter 7 regarding the axial skeleton. The questions likely cover topics such as:

*   Components of the axial skeleton (skull, vertebral column, thoracic cage).
*   Functions of the axial skeleton (protection, support, muscle attachment).
*   Identification and features of cranial bones (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, sphenoid, ethmoid) and facial bones (maxilla, mandible, zygomatic, nasal, lacrimal, palatine, vomer, inferior nasal concha).
*   Structures of the skull (sutures, paranasal sinuses, orbits, nasal cavity, fontanelles).
*   Structure and function of the hyoid bone.
*   Regions and curvatures of the vertebral column (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, coccygeal).
*   General structure of a vertebra (body, vertebral arch, processes).
*   Regional characteristics of vertebrae (e.g., atlas, axis, thoracic vertebrae with rib facets).
*   Structure and function of intervertebral discs.
*   Components of the thoracic cage (sternum, ribs - true, false, floating) and their articulations.
*   Development of the axial skeleton.

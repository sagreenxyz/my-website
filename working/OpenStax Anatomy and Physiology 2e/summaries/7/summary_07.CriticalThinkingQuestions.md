# Summary: Chapter 7 Critical Thinking Questions

This section presents questions that require deeper analysis and application of the concepts covered in Chapter 7 regarding the axial skeleton. These questions encourage students to think critically about the relationship between the structure and function of axial bones (e.g., how vertebral shape relates to regional function, how skull structure protects the brain), the clinical significance of certain features (e.g., fontanelles, intervertebral discs), and the developmental aspects of the axial skeleton.

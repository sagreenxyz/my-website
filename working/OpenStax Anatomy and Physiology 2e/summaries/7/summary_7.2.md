# Summary: 7.2 The Skull

This section describes the complex structure of the skull, including its constituent bones, sutures, cavities, and associated structures.

*   **Overview:**
    *   The most complex bony structure in the body, composed of 22 bones (plus 6 auditory ossicles and the hyoid bone).
    *   Protects the brain, supports facial structures, forms cavities for sensory organs (eyes, ears, nose), provides openings for air and food passage, and anchors muscles for facial expression and mastication.
*   **Divisions of Skull Bones:**
    *   **Cranial Bones (8):** Form the cranial cavity enclosing the brain.
        *   **Frontal Bone (1):** Forehead, superior orbits, anterior cranial floor. Contains frontal sinuses.
        *   **Parietal Bones (2):** Form most of the superior and lateral walls of the cranium.
        *   **Temporal Bones (2):** Form inferolateral walls and part of the cranial floor. House middle and inner ear structures. Key features: Squamous part, zygomatic process, mandibular fossa, external acoustic meatus, mastoid process, styloid process, petrous part.
        *   **Occipital Bone (1):** Forms posterior wall and most of the cranial base. Key features: Foramen magnum (spinal cord passage), occipital condyles (articulate with C1 vertebra), external occipital protuberance.
        *   **Sphenoid Bone (1):** Complex, bat-shaped bone; keystone of the cranium (articulates with all other cranial bones). Forms part of cranial base, sides, and orbits. Key features: Body (contains sphenoid sinuses), sella turcica (houses pituitary gland), greater and lesser wings, pterygoid processes.
        *   **Ethmoid Bone (1):** Deepest skull bone; between sphenoid and nasal bones. Forms part of anterior cranial floor, medial orbit walls, nasal septum, and roof/walls of nasal cavity. Key features: Cribriform plate (olfactory nerve passage), crista galli (dura mater attachment), perpendicular plate (part of nasal septum), superior and middle nasal conchae, ethmoid sinuses.
    *   **Facial Bones (14):** Form the framework of the face, provide cavities for sense organs, openings for air/food, anchor facial muscles.
        *   **Mandible (1):** Lower jawbone; largest, strongest facial bone. Only freely movable skull bone. Key features: Body, rami, condylar process (articulates with temporal bone - TMJ), coronoid process, mental foramen, mandibular foramen.
        *   **Maxillary Bones (Maxillae) (2):** Upper jawbones; keystone facial bones (articulate with all other facial bones except mandible). Form part of orbits, nasal cavity walls, hard palate. Contain maxillary sinuses. Key features: Alveolar processes (hold upper teeth), palatine process, frontal process, zygomatic process, infraorbital foramen.
        *   **Zygomatic Bones (2):** Cheekbones; form prominences of cheeks and inferolateral margins of orbits. Articulate with temporal, frontal, sphenoid, and maxillary bones.
        *   **Nasal Bones (2):** Form bridge of the nose.
        *   **Lacrimal Bones (2):** Form part of medial orbit walls; contain lacrimal fossa (houses lacrimal sac).
        *   **Palatine Bones (2):** L-shaped bones forming posterior part of hard palate and part of nasal cavity/orbit walls.
        *   **Vomer (1):** Forms inferior part of nasal septum.
        *   **Inferior Nasal Conchae (2):** Form part of lateral walls of nasal cavity (separate bones from superior/middle conchae of ethmoid).
*   **Sutures:** Immovable fibrous joints connecting most skull bones. Major sutures: Coronal, Sagittal, Lambdoid, Squamous.
*   **Fontanelles:** Fibrous membranes connecting cranial bones in infants ("soft spots"). Allow skull compression during birth and brain growth.
*   **Associated Structures:**
    *   **Orbits:** Bony cavities housing the eyes. Formed by parts of 7 bones (frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid, lacrimal, maxilla, palatine, zygomatic).
    *   **Nasal Cavity:** Formed by bone and cartilage. Divided by nasal septum (ethmoid perpendicular plate, vomer, cartilage). Lateral walls feature nasal conchae (superior, middle, inferior) that increase surface area and create air turbulence.
    *   **Paranasal Sinuses:** Air-filled cavities within certain cranial and facial bones (frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid, maxillary). Lighten the skull, enhance voice resonance, warm/humidify inhaled air. Lined with mucous membrane.
    *   **Hyoid Bone:** U-shaped bone in the anterior neck, inferior to mandible. Does not articulate directly with any other bone. Anchored by ligaments and muscles. Acts as a movable base for the tongue and attachment site for neck muscles involved in swallowing and speech.
    *   **Auditory Ossicles (6):** Malleus, incus, stapes (2 each) within middle ear cavities in temporal bones. Transmit sound vibrations.

The skull is a complex structure composed of many fused bones and some mobile bones, crucial for protecting the brain and housing sensory organs.

# Summary: 7.5 Embryonic Development of the Axial Skeleton

This section outlines the formation of the skull, vertebral column, and thoracic cage during embryonic and fetal development.

*   **Early Development:** The axial skeleton arises primarily from mesoderm, specifically the paraxial mesoderm and sclerotome portions of somites, as well as neural crest cells (for parts of the skull).
*   **Somites:** Blocks of paraxial mesoderm that form on either side of the neural tube. Each somite differentiates into:
    *   **Sclerotome:** Ventromedial part; gives rise to vertebrae and ribs.
    *   **Myotome:** Forms skeletal muscles.
    *   **Dermatome:** Forms dermis of the back.
*   **Vertebral Column Development:**
    *   Sclerotome cells migrate medially to surround the notochord and neural tube.
    *   **Resegmentation:** Each sclerotome splits into cranial and caudal halves. The caudal half of one sclerotome fuses with the cranial half of the sclerotome below it to form a vertebral body. This allows spinal nerves to exit between vertebrae and myotomes to span adjacent vertebrae.
    *   The notochord largely degenerates but persists as the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs.
    *   Ossification begins during the fetal period and continues after birth.
*   **Rib and Sternum Development:**
    *   Ribs develop from costal processes of the sclerotomes in the thoracic region.
    *   The sternum develops from paired sternal bars in the ventral body wall mesoderm, which fuse medially.
*   **Skull Development:**
    *   Complex origin involving mesoderm and neural crest cells.
    *   Develops in two parts:
        *   **Neurocranium:** Forms the protective case around the brain.
            *   **Chondrocranium (Cartilaginous Neurocranium):** Forms the base of the skull via endochondral ossification. Arises from mesoderm and neural crest cells.
            *   **Membranous Neurocranium:** Forms the flat bones of the cranial vault (roof and sides) via intramembranous ossification. Arises from mesoderm and neural crest cells.
        *   **Viscerocranium:** Forms the bones of the face, jaws, and hyoid apparatus. Arises mainly from neural crest cells associated with the pharyngeal arches. Develops via both intramembranous and endochondral ossification.
*   **Fontanelles:** Areas of fibrous connective tissue ("soft spots") between the cranial bones in the fetal and infant skull. Allow for skull deformation during birth and brain growth postnatally. They gradually ossify during the first two years.

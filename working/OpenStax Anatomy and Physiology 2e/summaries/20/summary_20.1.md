# Summary: 20.1 Structure and Function of Blood Vessels

This section describes the structure and function of the different types of blood vessels: arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins.

## General Structure (Arteries and Veins):

*   **Three Tunics (Layers):**
    1.  **Tunica Intima:** Innermost layer. Endothelium (simple squamous epithelium) lining the lumen, continuous with heart endocardium. Subendothelial layer (connective tissue). Internal elastic membrane (in arteries). Provides a smooth surface, releases chemicals.
    2.  **Tunica Media:** Middle layer, thickest in arteries. Smooth muscle and elastic fibers. Regulated by sympathetic vasomotor nerves for vasoconstriction/vasodilation, controlling blood flow and pressure. External elastic membrane (in arteries).
    3.  **Tunica Externa (Adventitia):** Outermost layer. Collagen fibers, connective tissue. Anchors vessel to surroundings. Contains nerve fibers, lymphatic vessels. Vasa vasorum (tiny vessels) nourish larger vessel walls.

## Types of Blood Vessels:

*   **Arteries:** Carry blood *away* from the heart. High pressure, thick walls (especially tunica media).
    *   *Elastic Arteries (Conducting):* Largest (e.g., aorta, major branches). Abundant elastin allows stretch/recoil to smooth out pressure fluctuations (pressure reservoir).
    *   *Muscular Arteries (Distributing):* Deliver blood to specific organs. Thickest tunica media relative to lumen size, active in vasoconstriction.
    *   *Arterioles (Resistance Vessels):* Smallest arteries. Lead into capillary beds. Tunica media mainly smooth muscle. Major site of resistance, regulating blood flow into capillaries via diameter changes.
*   **Capillaries:** Smallest vessels, thin walls (tunica intima only - endothelium and basement membrane). Site of exchange (gases, nutrients, wastes) between blood and tissues. Form extensive networks (capillary beds).
    *   *Types:* Continuous (most common, tight junctions), Fenestrated (pores, increased permeability, e.g., kidneys, small intestine), Sinusoid (large gaps, very leaky, e.g., liver, bone marrow, spleen).
    *   *Microcirculation:* Flow through capillary beds regulated by precapillary sphincters (smooth muscle cuffs) controlling flow into true capillaries from the metarteriole/thoroughfare channel.
*   **Veins:** Carry blood *toward* the heart. Low pressure, thinner walls, larger lumens than corresponding arteries.
    *   *Venules:* Smallest veins, formed when capillaries unite. Postcapillary venules are very porous. Larger venules have thin tunics.
    *   *Veins:* Formed by converging venules. Have three tunics, but media is thin and externa is thickest. Large lumens act as blood reservoirs (capacitance vessels, hold ~65% of blood volume).
    *   *Venous Valves:* Folds of tunica intima, prevent backflow, especially in limbs. Aided by skeletal muscle pump and respiratory pump to return blood to heart against gravity.

Blood vessels form a closed circulatory system, with distinct structural adaptations in arteries, capillaries, and veins reflecting their specific functions in transport, exchange, and blood storage.

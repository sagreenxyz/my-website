# Summary: 20.5 Circulatory Pathways

This section outlines the major circulatory routes in the body: the systemic and pulmonary circuits, including key arteries and veins.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Two Main Circuits:**
    1.  **Pulmonary Circuit:** Short loop carrying deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs for gas exchange and returning oxygenated blood to the left atrium.
        *   *Pathway:* Right Ventricle → Pulmonary Trunk → Pulmonary Arteries → Lung Capillaries (gas exchange) → Pulmonary Veins → Left Atrium.
        *   Low pressure system.
    2.  **Systemic Circuit:** Long loop carrying oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to all body tissues and returning deoxygenated blood to the right atrium.
        *   *Pathway:* Left Ventricle → Aorta → Systemic Arteries → Tissue Capillaries (gas exchange) → Systemic Veins → Superior/Inferior Vena Cava & Coronary Sinus → Right Atrium.
        *   High pressure system.

## Systemic Arteries:

*   **Aorta:** Largest artery, originates from the left ventricle. Regions:
    *   *Ascending Aorta:* Gives rise to coronary arteries.
    *   *Aortic Arch:* Curves left. Branches: Brachiocephalic trunk (→ right common carotid, right subclavian), Left common carotid artery, Left subclavian artery.
    *   *Descending Aorta:*
        *   *Thoracic Aorta:* Supplies thoracic structures.
        *   *Abdominal Aorta:* Supplies abdominal organs, ends by dividing into common iliac arteries.
*   **Major Arteries (Examples):**
    *   *Head/Neck:* Common Carotids (→ internal/external carotids), Vertebral arteries (from subclavians).
    *   *Upper Limb:* Subclavian → Axillary → Brachial → Radial & Ulnar arteries.
    *   *Thorax:* Intercostal, Bronchial arteries.
    *   *Abdomen:* Celiac trunk (→ gastric, splenic, hepatic), Superior/Inferior Mesenteric, Renal, Gonadal arteries.
    *   *Lower Limb:* Common Iliac → External Iliac → Femoral → Popliteal → Anterior/Posterior Tibial arteries.

## Systemic Veins:

*   **Vena Cavae:** Largest veins, empty into the right atrium.
    *   *Superior Vena Cava (SVC):* Drains regions superior to the diaphragm. Formed by union of right and left brachiocephalic veins (each formed by internal jugular and subclavian veins).
    *   *Inferior Vena Cava (IVC):* Drains regions inferior to the diaphragm. Formed by union of common iliac veins. Receives blood from abdominal organs (e.g., renal, gonadal, hepatic veins).
*   **Major Veins (Examples):** Often run parallel to corresponding arteries, but venous pathways are more interconnected and variable.
    *   *Head/Neck:* Internal/External Jugulars, Vertebral veins → Brachiocephalic veins. Dural venous sinuses drain the brain.
    *   *Upper Limb:* Digital → Palmar arches → Radial, Ulnar → Brachial → Axillary → Subclavian vein. Superficial veins: Cephalic, Basilic, Median cubital.
    *   *Thorax:* Azygos system (Azygos, Hemiazygos, Accessory hemiazygos) drains thoracic wall.
    *   *Abdomen:* Lumbar, Gonadal, Renal, Suprarenal, Hepatic veins drain into IVC.
    *   *Lower Limb:* Digital → Plantar arches → Anterior/Posterior Tibial, Fibular → Popliteal → Femoral → External Iliac → Common Iliac vein. Superficial veins: Great and Small Saphenous.
*   **Hepatic Portal System:** Unique venous system draining digestive organs (stomach, intestines, spleen, pancreas). Nutrient-rich, deoxygenated blood flows from these organs via the hepatic portal vein to the liver for processing *before* returning to the main systemic circulation (IVC) via hepatic veins.

The circulatory system consists of distinct pulmonary and systemic pathways, with a complex network of arteries distributing blood and veins returning it, including the specialized hepatic portal system.

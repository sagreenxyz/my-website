# Summary: 20.6 Development of Blood Vessels and Fetal Circulation

This section covers the embryonic development of blood vessels and the unique circulatory adaptations present in the fetus.

## Blood Vessel Development (Vasculogenesis & Angiogenesis):

*   **Origin:** Blood vessels arise from mesoderm during embryonic development.
*   **Vasculogenesis:** Formation of the first vessels from endothelial precursor cells (angioblasts) that aggregate into blood islands. These islands form tubes and connect to create the primary vascular plexus.
*   **Angiogenesis:** Growth of new vessels from pre-existing ones, involving sprouting, remodeling, and pruning of the initial network. Continues throughout life as needed (e.g., wound healing, tumor growth).
*   **Timing:** Begins early (Week 3), concurrent with heart development, establishing connections between the embryo, yolk sac, and placenta.

## Fetal Circulation:

*   **Purpose:** Adaptations necessary because fetal lungs are non-functional, and nutrient/gas exchange occurs via the placenta.
*   **Key Structures:**
    *   **Placenta:** Site of exchange between maternal and fetal blood (no direct mixing).
    *   **Umbilical Cord:** Contains:
        *   *One Umbilical Vein:* Carries oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood from the placenta to the fetus.
        *   *Two Umbilical Arteries:* Carry deoxygenated, waste-laden blood from the fetus to the placenta.
*   **Fetal Circulatory Pathway & Shunts:**
    1.  Oxygenated blood from the placenta travels via the umbilical vein toward the fetal liver.
    2.  **Ductus Venosus:** A shunt bypassing the liver sinusoids, allowing most blood from the umbilical vein to flow directly into the inferior vena cava (IVC). Mixes with deoxygenated blood returning from the lower body.
    3.  Blood enters the right atrium via the IVC.
    4.  **Foramen Ovale:** An opening in the interatrial septum. Most blood entering the right atrium flows directly through the foramen ovale into the left atrium, bypassing the pulmonary circuit.
    5.  Blood entering the right ventricle (mostly from SVC) is pumped into the pulmonary trunk.
    6.  **Ductus Arteriosus:** A connection between the pulmonary trunk and the aorta. Most blood in the pulmonary trunk bypasses the lungs by flowing through the ductus arteriosus into the aorta.
    7.  Oxygenated blood from the left atrium enters the left ventricle and is pumped into the aorta, supplying the systemic circulation (especially heart and brain).
    8.  Deoxygenated blood returns to the placenta via the umbilical arteries (branches of internal iliac arteries).
*   **Postnatal Changes:** At birth, lung inflation and clamping of the umbilical cord cause pressure changes that close the shunts:
    *   *Foramen Ovale:* Closes due to increased left atrial pressure, becomes the *fossa ovalis*.
    *   *Ductus Arteriosus:* Constricts due to increased blood O2 and other factors, becomes the *ligamentum arteriosum*.
    *   *Ductus Venosus:* Constricts, becomes the *ligamentum venosum*.
    *   *Umbilical Arteries:* Constrict, become *medial umbilical ligaments*.
    *   *Umbilical Vein:* Constricts, becomes the *ligamentum teres* (round ligament) of the liver.

Blood vessels develop early via vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Fetal circulation utilizes the placenta and specific vascular shunts (ductus venosus, foramen ovale, ductus arteriosus) to bypass the liver and lungs, adapting to gas exchange via the placenta until birth.

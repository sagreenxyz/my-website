# Summary: 20.3 Capillary Exchange

This section details the movement of substances between the blood in capillaries and the surrounding interstitial fluid and tissues.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Purpose:** Exchange of gases (O2, CO2), nutrients, hormones, and metabolic wastes between blood and tissues occurs across capillary walls.
*   **Mechanisms of Exchange:**
    1.  **Diffusion:** Movement down concentration gradients.
        *   *Lipid-soluble substances* (O2, CO2, steroid hormones) diffuse directly through endothelial cell membranes.
        *   *Water-soluble substances* (amino acids, sugars, ions) pass through intercellular clefts or fenestrations (pores). Larger molecules (proteins) are generally retained in capillaries (except sinusoids).
    2.  **Transcytosis:** Movement of large, lipid-insoluble molecules (e.g., some proteins) across endothelial cells via endocytosis and exocytosis.
    3.  **Bulk Flow (Filtration and Reabsorption):** Movement of fluid and dissolved solutes across capillary walls driven by pressure gradients. Important for regulating the relative volumes of blood and interstitial fluid.

## Bulk Flow Dynamics:

*   **Forces Driving Filtration (Fluid out of capillary):**
    *   *Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure (HPc):* Blood pressure inside capillaries; forces fluid out. Higher at the arteriolar end (~35 mmHg) than the venular end (~17 mmHg).
    *   *Interstitial Fluid Osmotic Pressure (OPif):* Osmotic pressure due to proteins in the interstitial fluid; pulls fluid out. Usually very low (~1 mmHg) as few proteins leak out.
*   **Forces Driving Reabsorption (Fluid into capillary):**
    *   *Capillary Colloid Osmotic Pressure (OPc) (Oncotic Pressure):* Osmotic pressure created by non-diffusible plasma proteins (mainly albumin) inside the capillary; pulls fluid in. Relatively constant (~26 mmHg).
    *   *Interstitial Fluid Hydrostatic Pressure (HPif):* Pressure of fluid in the interstitial space; pushes fluid in. Usually assumed to be close to zero (~0 mmHg).
*   **Net Filtration Pressure (NFP):** Determines the direction and amount of fluid movement.
    *   **Formula:** NFP = (Forces favoring filtration) - (Forces favoring reabsorption)
    *   NFP = (HPc + OPif) - (OPc + HPif)
    *   *Simplified:* NFP ≈ (HPc - OPc)
    *   *Arteriolar End:* HPc > OPc → Positive NFP → Filtration occurs.
    *   *Venular End:* OPc > HPc → Negative NFP → Reabsorption occurs.
*   **Overall Fluid Movement:** Slightly more fluid is filtered out (~20 L/day) than is reabsorbed (~17 L/day). The excess interstitial fluid (~3 L/day) and any leaked proteins are returned to the bloodstream via the lymphatic system, preventing edema (fluid accumulation).

Capillary exchange involves diffusion, transcytosis, and bulk flow, with bulk flow dynamics (hydrostatic and osmotic pressures) determining the net movement of fluid between plasma and interstitial space.
